The current game I am working on is [Pets and Fedoras](projects/pets-and-fedoras). It started out as a [Lasers and Feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings) hack where you play as animal spies like in a Saturday morning cartoon.

I haven't gotten to the playtesting stage yet -- I'm still writing it up. It shouldn't be taking this long to write  since it was suppose to be a one-page RPG. However, I found myself adding narrative structure to the game, leading to a minor bloat in size.

The addition in narrative structure has also caused the feel of the game to change. I'm not longer confident that the Lasers and Feelings core mechanic works well with the additions I've added. And since the original game is already so light, changing that mechanic out would essentially mean I'm no longer making a hack of it, right?

In fact, I'm not even sure that I still have a game. The version in my head is starting to look like corraborative mad libs instead. That may not be such a bad thing -- people used to love those. Only time will tell should I fully pursue this thread of design.

Peace,  
Mr. Zech
