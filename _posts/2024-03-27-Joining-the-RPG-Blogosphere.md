title: "Joining the RPG Blogosphere"
category: business

It's been said that the blogs are the dreams of the RPG community. As I'm nothing if not a dreamer, I too am throwing my metaphorical hat into the RPG blogosphere. 

In this blog, I plan to post the following:
* the RPGs I'm designing,
* musings on game design theory, and
* musings on the RPG scene.
And if I ever get down to it, I may also include 
* digital tools for my RPGs, and
* play reports and reviews.

To be honest, this isn't the first time I've tried to start a blog. I've made and deleted three or four before. They never work out because I'm an extremely inconsitent poster, and by the time I ever get back to them I seem to lose all my initial drive. So how can I ensure this time will be different?

My only plan to ensure this blog's survival is to publish things as soon as I put it down in digital print. This will probably result in raw ideas and prose. Maybe this blog will end up being the sketchy gas station sushi pack of an RPG blog. But at least it'll be something, and I can always come back to polish up anything that seems to be gold.

Peace,
Mr Zech.
