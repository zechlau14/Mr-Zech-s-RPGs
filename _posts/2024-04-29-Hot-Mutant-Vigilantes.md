I kinda did it. I took the time to do the layout of a project as promised.

It's just not the main project that I've been stalling on, [Pets and Fedoras](/projects/pets-and-fedoras-slides). Instead I laid out Hot Mutant Vigilantes.

Perhaps the reason I managed to put this out real quick is that the layout is just a simple one page back and front. Or perhaps it's the fact that this was for a jam with a deadline that pushed me towards completing it.

I want to say that I'll dedicate my energies to Pets and Fedoras now, but my energies are still on this [Hot Mutant Summer Jam](https://itch.io/jam/hot-mutant-summer-jam/rate/2676441). I am seriously considering putting together a second horror entry. In other words, more procrastination.

Peace,
Mr. Zech.
