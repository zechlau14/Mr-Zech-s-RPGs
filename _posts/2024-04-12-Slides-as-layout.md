I've been in the process of rewriting Pets and Fedoras after the [accidental break down](/_posts/2024-04-01-Breaking-your-prototype) of the game in the design process. 
I've made two big changes: the first in the core mechanic of the game, and the second in the layout of the game as in the title of this post.

Pets and Fedoras started out as a hack of [Lasers and Feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings), with a d6 dice pool as its core mechanic. However, in the latest version, I have completely removed the stat and dice mechanic. If there is a chance of failure at an action, players play rock paper scissors. Losers cartoonishly fail at the task, while winners succeed and have to help their struggling counterpart.
