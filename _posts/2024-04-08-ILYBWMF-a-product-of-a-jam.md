I recently released [I Love You But We Must Fight](projects/i-love-you-but-we-must-fight) for free on [itch.io](https://mrzech.itch.io/i-love-you-but-we-must-fight).

I started writing this game last year for the [Powered by Sentinel jam](https://itch.io/jam/sentinel-jam), but as I'm releasing it now I clearly didn't submit it last year. The jam gave me a push to create prompts for a veteran on what could be their final adventure before retiring. I found the jam a good spark to my limited creativity, and I intend to join more this year.

However, I didn't manage to make the jam's deadline because like a curveball, the game changed its trajectory just before it crossed the plate. I realised too late that most of the prompts that I wrote were about the veteran's relationship with their nemesis. The tone of the reflections went from "I'm too old for this s#@!" to the titular "I love you, please stop!". This new focus demanded some of the prompts to be rewritten and an entirely new end game.

Writing _I Love You But We Must Fight_ was a new experience for me: the first time I had completed a journaling game. I hope it won't be my last.
