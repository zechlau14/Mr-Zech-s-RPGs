title: Procrastinating On Layout By Working On Other Games
category: meta layout procrastination

Since my last [blog post](/Slides-as-layout/), I've been busy working on my games. 
In that post, I mentioned my breakthrough in working on [Pets & Fedoras](/projects/pets-and-fedoras-slides), and that I had been reworking its layout.
However, I haven't worked any on it since then. The last 10% (?) of the layout remains undone.
So what have I been doing instead?

Well I started a quick reskin of [Grant Howittâ€™s Sexy Battle Wizards](https://gshowitt.itch.io/sexy-battle-wizards), for the [Hot Mutant Summer Jam](https://itch.io/jam/hot-mutant-summer-jam).
The text of this is 90% done too. I just need to sit down and lay it out nicely on a single page.
Great! So you're almost ready to put out two small games, right?

Nope!!

Instead of finishing off the layout of either of those, I've been working on my [Heartbreaker](/projects/heartbreaker).
It's coming along pretty well, I've come up with a premise that I think is fairly unique. But I'm not sure if it's going to end up as a true heartbreaker, or more of a Forged in the Dark work.
It seems that I have ideas, but I really can't tell what their final form will end up being.

Anyway, I have a bad case of the procrastination by doing something else. This blog is going to end up a mad online sketchbook of 70% completed drafts.
Maybe I need an editor or writing partner to keep me on track. Or maybe I just need a solid block of time where I can sit down and focus on the layout.
The last time I completed a project, it was [Hot Dog Borg](https://mrzech.itch.io/hot-dog-borg). Its layout only got done because it was Eid and I had a few hours free to really mash it up on Canva.

Tomorrow will be my first true off day since Eid so I just might be able to focus and finish up those projects. No promises.

Peace,
Mr. Zech.
