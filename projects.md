## Current Works in Progress

### Pets and Fedoras
I'm currently working on [Pets and Fedoras](projects/pets-and-fedoras), a hack of [Lasers and Feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings).

You are spies with cover identities of regular house pets.  Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis is up to and put a stop to it!  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb.

### A Heartbreaker
I've been working on and off on a [heartbreaker](projects/heartbreaker), which is essentially a riff on `the world's most popular role-playing game'. I've never been completely satisfied with it, but I'm going to put it out there on the internet anyway. Maybe this will be the push for me to complete it.

## Completed Works

### [I Love You But We Must Fight](projects/i-love-you-but-we-must-fight)

A solo game in which you play out a single scene of a Hero preparing for the final showdown with their beloved, the Great Villain threatening the world.
