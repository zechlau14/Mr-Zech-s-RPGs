# Current Work in Progress

I'm currently working on [Pets and Fedoras](projects/pets-and-fedoras), a hack of [Lasers and Feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings).

You are spies with cover identities of regular house pets.  Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis is up to and put a stop to it!  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb.
