<h2 id="premise">Premise</h2>
<p>YOU ARE HOT MUTANT VIGILANTES.</p>
<p>More specifically, you are a student at a school for gifted
youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in
spandex and saving the world. The school has zero legal authority to do
this, hence the label ‘vigilante’. The government and the humans hate
you.</p>
<p>This work is directly inspired by the X-men.</p>

hot body.<br />

<strong>VIGILANTE!</strong> Fight crime without the approval of the
law.</p>
<p>Rate your stats at 1, 2 and 3 (best).</p>
<h2 id="play">Play</h2>
<p>One player is the GM who presents the situation, especially what is
going wrong. The other players are the Hot Mutant Vigilantes. They
describe what their characters do.</p>
<p>The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or
extra steps, or presents a risk. If the action would require a dice
roll, the GM will inform the players and assign its Difficulty. Players
may then revise their plans before committing to the action. Players
only roll when they have committed.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-dice">Rolling Dice</h2>
<p>When you act to gain an advantage or solve a difficult problem, roll
a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant stat. Spend
<strong>determination</strong> on a 1-for-1 basis to add additional dice
to the pool.</p>
<p>Compare your highest dice to the difficulty assigned by the GM.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If it is greater, you succeed.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is equal, you succeed, but gain 1 stress and the GM tells
you something bad that happens.</p></li>
<li><p>If it is lower, you fail, gain 1 stress and 1 determination. The
GM tells you something bad that happens.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="stress">Stress</h2>
<p>Stress represents your overall condition, including physical injury,
fatigue and emotional conditions like anger or embarrassment.</p>
<p>When you fail, if your total final stress is higher than the highest
dice rolled, decide with the GM how you are taken out of the scene. Some
possibilities are your character passes out, is physically thrown out,
or your character runs away. The GM will reintroduce your character in a
later fictionally-appropriate scene.</p>
<h2 id="difficulty">Difficulty</h2>
<p>The difficulty of a task is related to the <strong>impact of
success</strong> of the action that triggered it, not the complexity of
the action.</p>
<p>4 Standard results<br />
5 A great and audacious impact<br />
6 A clutch result that can really turn the tide of the situation</p>
<h2 id="gm-section">GM Section</h2>
<p>Give the players an inkling of what the first, obvious disaster is,
and let them go at it.</p>
