<h1>Pets and Fedoras</h1>
<p>A story game for 2 – 5 players, directly inspired by the cartoon
Phineas and Ferb.</p>

<div id="introduction-0" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 0</h1>
<p>Take turns reading the instruction slides out
loud.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-1" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 1</h1>
<p>You are fedora-wearing special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy
Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair
of genius children, Linneaus and Fern.</p>
<p>Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist
nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-2" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 2</h1>
<p>While you are away on mission, your genius owners are up to their own
mad science mega-project.</p>
<p>The story cuts back and forth between your mission and the children’s
project.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-3" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 3</h1>
<p>There are 5 Mission Slides and 5 Home Slides. Assign one of each to every player.</p>
<p>If you have less than 5 players, distribute the remaining Mission and
Home cards slides.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-4" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 4</h1>
<p>When we have read the Instructions cards, we will alternate between
Mission cards and Home cards, beginning with the 1st Mission Card.</p>
<p>In other words, the play order is Mission 1 -&gt; Home 1 -&gt;
Mission 2 -&gt; Home 2 -&gt; Mission 3 – &gt; etc.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-5" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 5</h1>
<p>On your turn, read your Mission or Home card out loud and answer its
question(s). You may choose and embellish an answer from the suggestion
list on the card or come up with something new.</p>
<p>Other players may ask you questions or make suggestions on your turn,
but whether you answer those questions or include those suggestions is
entirely up to you.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-6" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 6</h1>
<p>This game aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy
cartoon. Your answers should be family-friendly and fueled by cartoon
logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off
a cliff.</p>
<p>Cartoon violence is encouraged, but not blood and gore. Dr Goof, your
nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never
cruel.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-7" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 7</h1>
<p>On each Mission card, there is also a question for everyone. Take
turns answering it.</p>
<p>If a question is marked RPS, pair up and play rock paper scissors
(RPS) until one party wins to determine the order that you answer,
beginning with the losers. (Variant: If playing online, you may choose
to flip a coin instead.)<br />
If there are an odd number of players, the card reader does not play RPS
and may choose to join either the winner or loser side.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-8" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 8</h1>
<p>For questions marked RPS, if you lost at RPS, you answer first. Your
answer must include how your agent’s action cartoonishly fails.</p>
<p>If you won at RPS, you answer later. Your answer should include how
your agent succeeds and helps the agent of the player who lost in RPS
against you.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-9" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 9</h1>
<p>We will use a "virtual X-card".</p>
<p>If there is an answer in the game that you don’t want to be included,
type X in the chat, say “X!” or make an "X-shape" with your hands in the video. The answering player will provide a different
answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="introduction-10" class="slide section level1">
<h1>Introduction 10</h1>
<p> We will now create characters by answering the following questions. </p>
<p><strong>For everyone</strong>: What kind of house
<strong>pet</strong> are you? What is their <strong>cute pet
name</strong> and what is their <strong>agent code name</strong>?</p>
