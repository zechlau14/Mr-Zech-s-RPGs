a hack of [Grant Howitt's Sexy Battle Wizards](https://gshowitt.itch.io/sexy-battle-wizards). Created for [the Hot Mutant Summer Jam](https://itch.io/jam/hot-mutant-summer-jam).

## Premise

YOU ARE A HOT MUTANT VIGILANTE. 

You are a student at a school for gifted youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in spandex and defending the world. The school has zero legal authority to do this, hence the label 'vigilante'. The government and the humans hate you.

This work is directly inspired by the X-men.

## Character Creation

## Rolling Dice

You have three stats. Assign 1, 2 and 3 to each of your stats.
**Hot!**   
**Mutant!**  
**Vigilante!**  

When you act to gain an advantage or solve a difficult problem, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant stat. Spend determination (see below) on a 1-for-1 basis to add additional dice to the pool.

If your highest dice beats the difficulty, you succeed.  
If it's equal, you succeed, mark 1 stress and the GM tells you something bad that happens.
If it's lower, you fail, mark 1 stress and 1 determination and the GM tells you something bad that happens.

Stress represents your overall condition, including physical injury, fatigue and emotional conditions like anger or embarrassment. 

When you fail, if your total final stress is higher than the highest dice rolled, decide with the GM how you are taken out of the scene. Some possibilities are your character passes out, is physically thrown out, or your character runs away.
