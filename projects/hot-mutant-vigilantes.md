a hack of [Grant Howitt's Sexy Battle Wizards](https://gshowitt.itch.io/sexy-battle-wizards). Created for [the Hot Mutant Summer Jam](https://itch.io/jam/hot-mutant-summer-jam).

## Premise

YOU ARE A HOT MUTANT VIGILANTE. 

You are a student at a school for gifted youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in spandex and defending the world. The school has zero legal authority to do this, hence the label 'vigilante'. The government and the humans hate you.

This work is directly inspired by the X-men.
