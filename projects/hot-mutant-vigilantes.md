## Premise

YOU ARE A HOT MUTANT VIGILANTE. 

You are a student at a school for gifted youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in spandex and defending the world. The school has zero legal authority to do this, hence the label 'vigilante'. The government and the humans hate you.

This work is a hack of [Grant Howitt's Sexy Battle Wizards](https://gshowitt.itch.io/sexy-battle-wizards), created for [the Hot Mutant Summer Jam](https://itch.io/jam/hot-mutant-summer-jam) and directly inspired by the X-men.

What is your vigilante specialty? (d6)

You have three stats. Assign 1, 2 and 3 to each of your stats.  
**HOT!** Charm baddies with your skin-tight spandex-clad hot body.  
**MUTANT!** Unleash your mutant superpower.  
**VIGILANTE!** Fight crime without the approval of the law.

## Rolling Dice

When you act to gain an advantage or solve a difficult problem, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant stat. Spend determination (see below) on a 1-for-1 basis to add additional dice to the pool.

If your highest dice

* beats the dificult, you succeed.

* is equal to the difficulty, you succeed, gain 1 stress and the GM tells you something bad that happens.

* is lower than the difficulty, you fail, gain 1 stress and 1 determination and the GM tells you something bad that happens.

Stress represents your overall condition, including physical injury, fatigue and emotional conditions like anger or embarrassment. 

When you fail, if your total final stress is higher than the highest dice rolled, decide with the GM how you are taken out of the scene. Some possibilities are your character passes out, is physically thrown out, or your character runs away.

## GM Section

Give the players an inkling of what the first, obvious disaster is, and let them go at it.

The difficulty of a task is related to the **impact of success**, not the complexity of the task.  
4: standard stuff with standard results  
5: Audacious or risky stuff with a great impact  
6: Clutch, against-the-odds stuff that can really turn the tide of the situation  

If an NPC isn't kissable, think "Could I make them kissable?"

3. on a living mutant island
4. displaced from the time stream
5. an anti-mutant march at the Capital
