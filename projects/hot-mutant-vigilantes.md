## Premise

YOU ARE A HOT MUTANT VIGILANTE. 

You are a student at a school for gifted youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in spandex and defending the world. The school has zero legal authority to do this, hence the label 'vigilante'. The government and the humans hate you.

This work is directly inspired by the X-men.

## Rolling Dice

You have three stats. Assign 1, 2 and 3 to each of your stats.  
**Hot!**   
**Mutant!**  
**Vigilante!**  

When you act to gain an advantage or solve a difficult problem, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant stat. Spend determination (see below) on a 1-for-1 basis to add additional dice to the pool.

If your highest dice beats the difficulty, you succeed.  
If it's equal, you succeed, mark 1 stress and the GM tells you something bad that happens.
If it's lower, you fail, mark 1 stress and 1 determination and the GM tells you something bad that happens.

Stress represents your overall condition, including physical injury, fatigue and emotional conditions like anger or embarrassment. 

When you fail, if your total final stress is higher than the highest dice rolled, decide with the GM how you are taken out of the scene. Some possibilities are your character passes out, is physically thrown out, or your character runs away.

## GM Section

Give the players an inkling of what the first, obvious disaster is, and let them go at it.

The difficulty of a task is related to the **impact of success**, not the complexity of the task.  
4: standard hot mutant vigilante stuff with standard results  
5: Audacious or risky stuff that has a great impact  
6: Clutch, against-the-odds stuff that can really turn the tide of the situation  

If an NPC isn't kissable, think "Could I make them kissable?"

What's going wrong? (Roll twice; one disaster hides another much more dangerous disaster)
1. A fellow student's mutation is out of control
2. Mutant terrorist are trying to assassinate a mutant-hating senator
3. The principal of the school has been kidnapped
4. An underground commune of mutants are under attack
5. 

What's this place like?
1. 

Who's going to stand in our way? (Roll twice)
1. A sexy Alien Monarch and their army
2. The government's inexplicably sexy mutant-hunting robots
3. The principal's sexy Mutant rival
4. A sexy cyborg out for revenge
5. A sexy time traveller intent on "fixing the timeline"
6. The sexy mutant who was expelled from the school last year
