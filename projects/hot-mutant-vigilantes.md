## Premise

YOU ARE A HOT MUTANT VIGILANTES.

More specifically, you are a student at a school for gifted youngsters where the extra-curricular activities involve dressing up in spandex and saving the world. The school has zero legal authority to do this, hence the label 'vigilante'. The government and the humans hate you.

This work is directly inspired by the X-men.

Rate your stats at 1, 2 and 3 (best).

## Play

One player is the GM who presents the situation, especially what is going wrong. The other players are the Hot Mutant Vigilantes. They describe what their characters do.

The GM advises when their action is impossible, demands a cost or extra steps, or presents a risk. If the action would require a dice roll, the GM will inform the players and assign its Difficulty. Players may then revise their plans before committing to the action. Players only roll when they have committed.

## Rolling Dice

When you act to gain an advantage or solve a difficult problem, roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the most relevant stat. Spend **determination** on a 1-for-1 basis to add additional dice to the pool.

Compare your highest dice to the difficulty assigned by the GM.

* If it is greater, you succeed.

* If it is equal, you succeed, but gain 1 stress and the GM tells you something bad that happens.

* If it is lower, you fail, gain 1 stress and 1 determination. The GM tells you something bad that happens.

## Stress

Stress represents your overall condition, including physical injury, fatigue and emotional conditions like anger or embarrassment. 

When you fail, if your total final stress is higher than the highest dice rolled, decide with the GM how you are taken out of the scene. Some possibilities are your character passes out, is physically thrown out, or your character runs away. The GM will reintroduce your character in a later fictionally-appropriate scene.

## Difficulty

The difficulty of a task is related to the **impact of success** of the action that triggered it, not the complexity of the action.  

4  Standard results  
5  A great and audacious impact  
6  A clutch result that can really turn the tide of the situation

## GM Section

Give the players an inkling of what the first, obvious disaster is, and let them go at it.

**What's going wrong?** (Roll twice; one disaster hides another much more dangerous disaster)

1. A fellow student's mutation is out of control
2. Mutant terrorist are plotting to assassinate a prominent mutant-hating senator
3. The principal of the school is missing
4. An underground commune of mutants is under attack
5. A mutant-loving/hating cult has formed
6. The base of the government's secret mutant-kidnapping operation is discovered

What's **this place** like?

1. a cold, sterile environment of mutant science
2. a military town attached to the largest anti-mutant base
3. on a living mutant island
4. displaced from the time stream
5. an anti-mutant march at the steps of the Capital
6. a sleepaway summer camp in a creepy forest

Who's going to **stand in our way**? (Roll twice)

1. A sexy Alien Monarch
2. The government's inexplicably sexy mutant-hunting robots
3. The principal's sexy Mutant rival
4. A sexy cyborg out for revenge
5. A sexy time traveller intent on "fixing the timeline"
6. The sexy mutant who was expelled from the school last year

If an NPC isn't kissable, think "Could I make them kissable?"
