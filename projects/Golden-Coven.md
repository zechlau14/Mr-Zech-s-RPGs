## Premise
This is a storytelling game about young witches and wizards pushing their luck and helping each other get by. 

## Character Creation

What is your magical specialty?

What is your mundane hobby?

## Rolling the Dice

Each Wizard's Player needs two six-sided dice of different colours. The first is their "Mundane Die" (MD) and the second is their "Wizarding Die" (WD).

### The Mundane Move
When you attempt a risky mundane action or reaction, say what you are afraid will happen if you fail. The GM may tell you that it’s worse than you fear. Then roll your mundane die.
6: success
4 – 5: mixed success
1 – 3: fail
If your mundane hobby would be helpful to this activity, you may reroll and take the higher result.

### Mundane Aid
When another character is making the Mundane Move, you may expose yourself to the same risk and offer mundane assistance. Say how you are going to help, then roll your Mundane die. If your result is higher than theirs, it replaces theirs.
