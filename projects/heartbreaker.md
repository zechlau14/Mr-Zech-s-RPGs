It seems that everyone in this corner of the internet has published their own house rules for the dungeon-based fantasy RPG. Here I shall do the same. These rules take inspiration from Searchers of the Unknown (SOTU) and the Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLOG).

## Premise of the Game
Every hack of the most popular tabletop role-playing game of the 20th century always seems to focus on the second D in its name -- the dungeons. In fact, I even called it the "dungeon-based fantasy RPG" in an earlier draft. To make this hack stand out, I will instead focus on the first D -- the dragons.

Every player character (PC) has dragon-blood in them. Due to this dragon-blood, PCs grow more powerful when they hoard gold. In terms of mechanics, this means "gold for XP". There is no "carousing" requirement, because the treasure must be hoarded. If a PC's hoard decreases below a level's threshold, either by the PC spending it or it being stolen/destroyed, then the PC loses access to that level's abilities until they rebuild their hoard.

PCs may choose to embrace the dragon abilities, eventually becoming a dragon themself, or they may choose to remain rooted in whatever species they chose at character creation. Mechanically, this means "Race as class". Beyond their racial abilities, each PC is an adventurer capable of wielding both sword and sorcery, with diegetic options to specialise.

As for the setting, the world is filled with dungeons to crawl because many dragon and their descendants instinctively build them to protect their hoards. When making conversions, the DM (Dragon-Mother) is encouraged to sprinkle in as much dragon-motifs as possible, and to convert any interesting NPC to dragon-blood.

At higher levels, PCs are encouraged to embrace domain play, in which they build their own dungeon to protect their hoard.

## Core Gameplay Loop
The game is played in turns. Turns usually go like this.
1. The Dragon-Mother (DM) presents the location and scenario that the Players' characters (PCs) find themselves in.
2. The Players can ask for more details. The DM will answer honestly, but the answer may be that the PCs must investigate to find out.
3. When the Players' questions are answered, they say what their PCs want to do in response. If there is risk involved in the Player's choice, the DM will inform them of it and ask if the Player still wants to proceed.
4. If the outcome of the PC's action is interesting and uncertain, a Roll is required to determine the outcome.
5. When the outcome of their action is certain, the DM declares it to the players.
6. Finally, the DM takes their turn, causing the location and/or the non-player characters (NPCs) to act, restarting the Gameplay loop.

### the Roll
When a Roll is called for, the DM will tell you the target number (TN) the roll must meet to succeed. If you agree to take the risk, then roll a twenty-sided die (d20) and add the appropriate bonus.

If you have an advantage that makes the task that requires a roll easier, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher result. If you have a disadvantage on such a task, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower result. The DM has final say on whether you have advantage or disadvantage.

If you have multiple advantages, then the task is no longer challenging and succeeds without a roll. If you have multiple disadvantages, then the task is too difficult and will automatically fail.

## Elements of a Character

### Species

Each species in the setting has a unique set of abilities. When a PC levels up, they gain the next feature from one of their species. 

Each PC starts with at least two species:
* their primary species, ie. the species that the inhabitants of the world immediately recognise you as from your physical appearance, and
* dragon-blood, as one of their ancestors was a dragon.
With your DM's approval, you may also start with a third species, representing your mixed-lineage.

### Hit Points and Wounds
Hit Points reflects a PC's ability to avoid danger.  

When your HP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is taken as Wounds. You must then make a Roll (no bonus) to remain conscious, against TN = 10 + Wounds. An unconscious PC regains consciousness when they recover HP. 

If you ever reach 10 Wounds, you die. 

#### Healing
If you rest for 10 minutes, recover 1d6 HP.

If you rest for 30 minutes and eat a Ration, recover all HP. 

Wounds can only be healed at a safe haven. Each night you are safe and well-fed, remove 1 Wound. A healer will speed up the process.

### Bonuses
* Attack: to weapon attacks, combat stunts, using brute force on an object
* Armor: to yourself against weapon attacks or combat stunts
* Move: to difficult movements like acting quickly in combat, fleeing a monster, moving stealthily.
* Save: to resist magic or emotional compulsions
* Luck: for outcomes purely in fate's hands

### Drives
Besides your Draconic greed for gold, you have other drives pushing you to this life of adventure and risk. Examples: "seek knowledge", "help the innocent", "get ladies", "protect my friend" etc.

Whenever you make a sacrifice or invite trouble in pursuit of your Drive, fate smiles on you, increase your Luck bonus by 1 (to a max of +4).

#### Burning Luck
When you make a Roll without advantage, you may decrease your luck (to a min of -4). If you decrease your luck, you gain advantage to the roll.

### Inventory
PCs have 12 Basic Inventory Slots in total. The first 3 Slots are items that you have in hand, and can be accessed at any time. The other Basic Inventory Slots represent the armor you are wearing and a large backpack. It takes one combat round to retrieve any other item from your backpack.

An Inventory Slot can contain
* 3 Light objects, such as rations, torches, flasks, daggers.
* 1 Medium object, such as a sword, a quiver of 20 arrows / bolts, a lantern.
* 0.5 Heavy (2-handed) Weapon, e.g. greatsword
* 100 Coins
Armor takes up as many inventory slots as the bonus it provides. 

In addition to the basic inventory slots, PCs have 4 Encumbrance Slots. Each encumbrance slot used imposes a -1 penalty to your Move. If your Move bonus reaches -5, you can no longer move.

### Legendarium
* Your Hoard
* Skills? (4)
* Saves? (4)
* Class features?

## Level 0 Character Creation

1. Choose your primary species, ie. the species that the inhabitants of the world immediately recognise you as from your looks.
    * Human
    * Dog
    * Halfling
2. Roll a four-sided dice (d4) for your Maximum Hit Points (Max HP).
3. Fill in the rest of your stats.
    * Max Hit Points (d4)

    * 3 torches (1 slot)
    * The tools of your former profession (1 slot)
    * A weapon (1 slot)
    * 3d6 silver
6. Give your PC a name. If you already know what drives them to adventure, you may record it at this time.

## Advancement
Your hoard determines your level, and hence your PC's base power level.

| Level | Hoard (gp) | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1,000 |
| 2 | 3,000 | 
| 3 | 6,000 |
| 4 | 10,000 |

When you level up, you gain the following:
* Increase your HP by d4
* Increase your Attack bonus by 1
* Increase your Save bonus by 1
* Gain one new Species feature, choosing from the next available features of your species.
