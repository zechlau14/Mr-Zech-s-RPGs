It seems that everyone in this corner of the internet has published their own house rules for the dungeon-based fantasy RPG. Here I shall do the same. These rules take inspiration from Searchers of the Unknown (SOTU) and the Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLOG).

## Premise of the Game
Every hack of the most popular tabletop role-playing game of the 20th century always seems to focus on the second D in its name -- the dungeons. In fact, I even called it the "dungeon-based fantasy RPG" in an earlier draft. To make this hack stand out, I will instead focus on the first D -- the dragons.

Every player character (PC) has dragon-blood in them. Due to this dragon-blood, PCs grow more powerful when they hoard gold. In terms of mechanics, this means "gold for XP". There is no "carousing" requirement, because the treasure must be hoarded. If a PC's hoard decreases below a level's threshold, either by the PC spending it or it being stolen/destroyed, then the PC loses access to that level's abilities until they rebuild their hoard.

PCs may choose to embrace the dragon abilities, becoming more and more dragon-like, or they may choose to remain rooted in whatever species they chose at character creation. Mechanically, this means "Race as class". Beyond their racial abilities, each PC is an adventurer capable of wielding both sword and sorcery, with diegetic options to specialise.

As for the setting, the world is filled with dungeons to crawl because many dragon and their descendants instinctively build them to protect their hoards. These dungeons need loyal guards who will not be tempted by greed, so dragons love creating undead minions. The DM (Dragon-Mother) is encouraged to sprinkle in as much dragon and undead motifs as possible, and to make any interesting NPC either an undead or a dragon-blood.

At higher levels, PCs are encouraged to embrace domain play, in which they build their own dungeon to protect their hoard.

## Player Agenda
* Play to your character's drives
* Ask questions
* Be creative. The best plans guarantee success.
* Embrace your character's death

## Core Gameplay Loop
The game is played in turns. Turns usually go like this.
1. The Dragon-Mother (DM) presents the location and scenario that the Players' characters (PCs) find themselves in.
2. The Players can ask for more details. The DM will answer honestly, but the answer may be that the PCs must investigate to find out.
3. When the Players' questions are answered, they say what their PCs want to do in response. If there is risk involved in the Player's choice, the DM will inform them of it and ask if the Player still wants to proceed.
4. If the outcome of the PC's action is interesting and uncertain, a Roll is required to determine the outcome.
5. When the outcome of their action is certain, the DM declares it to the players.
6. Finally, the DM takes their turn, causing the location and/or the non-player characters (NPCs) to act, restarting the Gameplay loop.

### the Roll
When a Roll is called for, the DM will tell you the target number (TN) the roll must meet to succeed. If you agree to take the risk, then roll a twenty-sided die (d20) and add the appropriate bonus.

If you are acting against another PC, the DM does not assign a TN. Instead, all Players involved roll, and the highest roll has their way.

If you have an advantage that makes the task that requires a roll easier, you roll the d20 twice and take the higher result. If you have a disadvantage on such a task, you roll the d20 twice and take the lower result. The DM has final say on whether you have advantage or disadvantage.

If you have multiple advantages, then the task is no longer challenging and succeeds without a roll. If you have multiple disadvantages, then the task is too difficult and will automatically fail.

## Elements of a Character

### Species

Each species in the setting has a unique set of abilities. When a PC levels up, they gain the next feature from one of their species. 

Each PC starts with at least two species:
* their primary species, ie. the species that the inhabitants of the world immediately recognise you as from your physical appearance, and
* dragon-blood, as one of their ancestors was a dragon.
With your DM's approval, you may also start with a third species, representing your mixed-lineage.

### Hit Points and Wounds
Hit Points reflects a PC's ability to avoid danger.  

When your HP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is taken as Wounds. You must then make a Roll (no bonus) to remain conscious, against TN = 10 + Wounds. An unconscious PC regains consciousness when they recover HP. 

If you ever reach 10 Wounds, you die. 

#### Healing
If you rest for 10 minutes, recover 1d6 HP.

If you rest for 30 minutes and eat a Ration, recover all HP. 

Wounds can only be healed at a safe haven. Each night you are safe and well-fed, remove 1 Wound. A healer will speed up the process.

### Bonuses
* Attack: to weapon attacks, combat stunts, using brute force on an object
* Armor: to yourself against weapon attacks or combat stunts
* Move: to difficult movements like acting quickly in combat, fleeing a monster, moving stealthily.
* Save: to resist magic or emotional compulsions
* Luck: for outcomes purely in fate's hands

### Drives
Besides your Draconic greed for gold, you have other drives pushing you to this life of adventure and risk. Examples: "seek knowledge", "help the innocent", "get ladies", "protect my friend" etc.

Whenever you make a sacrifice or invite trouble in pursuit of your Drive, fate smiles on you, increase your Luck bonus by 1 (to a max of +4).

#### Burning Luck
When you make a Roll without advantage, you may decrease your luck (to a min of -4). If you decrease your luck, you gain advantage to the roll.

### Inventory
PCs have different types of Inventory Slots.

* 3 On-hand Slots
These represent items that you are carrying in hand or on an easily accessible part of your body, such as a lasso hanging from your belt, the quiver for your bow, or an arming sword in its sheath by your side. These can be accessed at any time.

* 6 Body Slots
These represent items worn on your person, such as any armor or headwear. Your regular clothes do not count towards these slots. Each piece of armor that you wear gives you a +1 to your Armor bonus, but a -1 penalty to your Move bonus.  
If you do not wear full armor, you may use these slots to store other objects if you can justify wearing them on your person. Slots used in this manner will also cause a -1 Move penalty.

* 8 Backpack Slots
These represent items carried in a backpack. Getting these items out requires at least one combat turn.  
6 slots fit well in the backpack. But you can overstuff the backpack with an extra two slots -- each of these slots used causes a -1 Move penalty.

Note: If you reach -5 Move, you are too encumbered and can only move slowly.

An Inventory Slot can contain
* 3 Light objects, such as rations, torches, flasks, daggers.
* 1 Medium object, such as a sword, a quiver of 20 arrows / bolts, a lantern.
* 0.5 Heavy (2-handed) Weapon, e.g. greatsword
* 100 Coins

### Your Hoard
As a dragon-blood, you hoard treasure just as much as gold. When your party come away with a valuable treasure, decide which of you will keep it. (You may need to negotiate and trade gold and treasure around to ensure fairness.) Whoever keeps the treasure writes it down on their sheet in this section, and they gain the its value in XP.

### Your Prepared Spells and Skills 
Your character may learn spells, martial skills and magical languages. Record them here.

## Level 0 Character Creation

1. Choose your primary species, ie. the species that the inhabitants of the world immediately recognise you as from your looks.
    * Human
    * Dog
    * Halfling
2. Roll a four-sided dice (d4) for your Maximum Hit Points (Max HP).
3. Fill in the rest of your stats.
    * Attack  0

    * Flesh  0
    * Move  3
    * Save  0
4. Choose your former profession. 
5. Fill in your inventory with
    * 3 days of rations (1 slot)
    * 3 torches (1 slot)
    * A d6 weapon (1 slot)
    * 2 random items (2 slots)
    * 3d6 silver
6. Give your PC a name. If you already know what drives them to adventure, you may record it at this time.

## Advancement
Your hoard determines your level, and hence your PC's base power level.

| Level | Hoard (gp) | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1000 |
| 2 | 3000 | 
| 3 | 7000 |
| 4 | 15000 |

When you level up, you gain the following:
* Increase your HP by d4
* Increase your Attack bonus by 1
* Increase your Save bonus by 1
* Gain one Mana Die
* Gain one new Species feature, choosing from the next available features of your species.

### Mana Die and Spellcasting

### Species
Each Species has 4 features. The features are gained sequentially. 

Each PC has at least two species they may choose from at level up: their primary species and the dragon-blood. If in your game, the PC has been biten by a goblin or an undead, those species' features are also available to you.

If you wish to play a mixed species character, please discuss with your DM at character generation.

## Equipment

## Hirelings

Creating a hireling.

## Subsystems

### Exploration

#### Random Encounter Roll
The noisiest PC, DM's choice, makes a Luck Roll (usually vs. TN 12). On a failure, something or someone comes your way.

#### Reaction Roll
When you encounter strangers, the most visible party member makes a Luck Roll to determine their reaction to the party.

| Luck Roll | Reaction |
| --- | --- |
| 1- | Hostile |
| 2-6 | Aggressive | 
| 7-14 | Uncertain |
| 15-19 | Indifferent |
| 20+ | Friendly |

#### Dungeons
A Dungeon Turn takes about 10 minutes. In that time, PCs may
* Move cautiously through 120 feet, spotting traps along the way,
* Move quickly through 360 feet, discovering traps by triggering them,
* Search a small room
* Force a door open, including by lockpicking
* Take a break, to heal 1d6 HP.

A torch provides bright light in a 30 feet radius, and dim light for another 30 feet. It lasts for an hour, ie. 6 dungeon turns. When acting without light, all Rolls that rely on sight are made with disadvantage.

Every 30 minutes, ie. after 3 dungeon turns, or whenever a loud noice occurs, make a Random Encounter Roll. 

#### Wilderness
PCs can travel at 3 miles per hour if the terrain and weather is good. At half that speed if the terrain is difficult.

Make a Random Encounter roll every 3 hours or whenever the PCs do something that's likely to attract attention.

PCs can safely travel for 8 hours per day. For each further hour of travel, PCs take a Wound and then make a Roll against their Wound TN. On a fail, that PC is no longer able to keep up and must rest.

### Social
Reaction

### Combat

#### Turn Order 
If anyone attacks by surprise, they get an extra turn to act before regular turns begin.

To determine the turn order of the Combat round, make a Move roll against the enemies' Move TN. PCs who succeed act before the enemies, PCs who fail act afterwards.

#### Your Turn

On their turn, a PC can move up to (25 + Move*5) feet. And they can do one of the following:
* Make an Attack roll against a target
* Dash, ie. move up to another (25 + Move*5) feet
* Cast a spell
* Retrieve an item from your backpack
* Use an item
* Make a combat maneuver against a target, like trip, shove, grapple, etc.
Talking or dropping an item can be done freely, and possibly even on someone else's turn. 

Attack rolls are made against the enemy's Armor TN. Ranged attacks are made at disadvantage if the enemy is far away.
On a successful Attack roll, roll your weapon die and reduce the target's HP by that amount. If you roll a 20 on the d20, the attack deals twice as much damage OR you gain a free combat maneuver. If you roll a 1 on the d20, the attack misses and the enemy gets a free counter-attack against you.

| Weapon type | Weapon die |
| --- | --- |
| Unarmed | d2 |
| Improvised weapons* | 1d6 |
| Regular weapons | 1d6 |
| 2-handed weapons | 1d8 |
Note: Improvised weapons make Attack rolls with a -2 penalty.

When you make a combat maneuver, such as tripping, shoving, etc., you make either an Attack or Move Roll versus the opponent's Armor or Move TN. The DM decides which bonus is most applicable. On a success, you perform the maneuver.

#### Defending
When an enemy attacks you, make an Armor roll against their Attack TN. If you succeed, they miss. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you may make a free counter attack or combat maneuver. If you roll a 1 on the d20, the enemy does double damage to you.

#### Fleeing
If you decide to flee combat, on your turn, make a Move Roll versus the Move TN of the enemy you are engaged with. 

#### Morale
When combat turns against the NPCs, such as
1. when their side takes their first death,
2. when half their side has been incapacitated or killed, or
3. if some particularly frightening or spectacular effect occurs,
the most terrifying PC in that combat, DM's choice, makes a Luck roll versus the enemies Save TN. If the roll succeeds, the NPCs try to run away or surrender

## Running the Game

### Rolls
If success or failure is inevitable, don't call for a Roll. Only call for a Roll if both success and failure lead to interesting outcomes. 

Don't gatekeep information behind a Roll. If there's a chance the Player sees it, tell them.

Failed Rolls have consequences. Sometimes, the most obvious one is a time penalty. Wasted time means more chances for bad things to happen to the PCs.

#### Usual Target Numbers (TN)
If your module does not give a target number for a save or check, use the following:
* Move: 11
* Moving Stealthily: 15
* Saves: 10+HD or 15

### Conversions

#### Saves
5 saves

Fort, Reflex, Will

#### Monsters
* Max Hit Points (HD * d6)
* Attack TN = 10+HD
* Armor TN = identical if ascending AC. If descending, subtract its AC from 19 if it is from OD&D or B/X D&D, or from 20 if from AD&D.
* Move TN = 10 + X, where X is 0 for 25ft. Add 1 for every increase of 5 ft. e.g. Move of 40ft => Move TN = 13.
* Save TN = 10+HD, includes Morale.
