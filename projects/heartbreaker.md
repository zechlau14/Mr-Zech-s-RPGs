Last updated: April 19th, 2024

It seems that everyone in this corner of the internet has published their own house rules for the dungeon-based fantasy RPG. Here I shall do the same. These rules take inspiration from Searchers of the Unknown (SOTU), Into the Odd and the Goblin Laws of Gaming (GLOG).

# WIP Title: Goblins and Dragons

## Why this Heartbreaker?

Every hack of the most popular tabletop role-playing game of the 20th century always seems to focus on the first D in its name -- the dungeons. In fact, I even called it the "dungeon-based fantasy RPG" in an earlier draft. To make this hack stand out, I will instead focus on the second D -- the dragons.

Every player character (PC) has dragon-blood in them. Subconsciously this dragon-blood drives them toward acquiring gold. The Dragon-blood causes PCs to grow more powerful when they hoard gold. In terms of mechanics, this means "gold for XP". There is no "carousing" requirement, because the treasure must be hoarded. If a PC's hoard decreases below a level's threshold, either by the PC spending it or it being stolen/destroyed, then the PC loses access to that level's abilities until they rebuild their hoard.

PCs may choose to embrace the dragon abilities, becoming more and more dragon-like, or they may choose to remain rooted in whatever species they chose at character creation. Mechanically, this means "Race as class". Beyond their racial abilities, each PC is a member of that legal get rich quick if you don't die profession -- archaelogist (read: tomb-raiding **rogue**).

As for the setting, the world is littered with tombs of treasure. The largest religion believes that gold is the foundation for a good afterlife, and one must be buried with it. They also believe in binding servants into service in the afterlife, burying them together with their masters and animating the corpses to protect the tombs. Gold is reserved for the dead, the living use the silver standard.

There are also dungeons to crawl because dragons and their descendants instinctively build them to protect their hoards. The DM (Dragon-Mother) is encouraged to sprinkle in as much dragon and undead motifs as possible, and to make any interesting NPC either an undead or a dragon-blood.

Starting from the mid-levels, PCs are encouraged to embrace domain play, in which they build their own dungeon to protect their hoard.

## Player Agenda

* Play to your character's drives
* Ask questions
* Be creative. The best plans guarantee success.
* Embrace your character's death

## Core Gameplay Loop

The game is played in turns. Turns usually go like this.

1. The Dragon-Mother (DM) presents the location and scenario that the Players' characters (PCs) find themselves in due to their pursuit of their drives, usually gold.
2. The Players can ask for more details. The DM will answer honestly, but the answer may be that the PCs must investigate to find out.
3. When the Players' questions are answered, they say what their PCs want to do in response. If there is risk involved in the Player's choice, the DM will inform them of it and ask if the Player still wants to proceed.
4. If the outcome of the PC's action is interesting and uncertain, a Roll is required to determine the outcome.
5. When the outcome of their action is certain, the DM declares it to the players.
6. Finally, the DM takes their turn, causing the location and/or the non-player characters (NPCs) to act, restarting the Gameplay loop.

### the Roll

When a Roll is required, the DM will clarify the following with you and the table:

* What are you trying to accomplish? And how well can you accomplish it?

* What is at risk here? ie. What badly could it go wrong if you fail?

The DM then tell you which target number (TN) the roll must meet to succeed. The TN is usually on your or the opposing NPC's character sheet. If you agree to take the risk, then roll a twenty-sided die (d20), adding your Skill bonus if appropriate.

If you are acting against another PC, all Players involved roll. Whichever Player has the highest roll among those who succeeded against their respective TN has their way.

## Elements of a Character

### Hit Points and Wounds

Hit Points reflects a PC's ability to avoid danger.  Wounds are the amount of damage your body has taken. If you ever reach 10 Wounds, you die.

Your Wound TN is 10 + Wounds. You may have to Roll against your Wound TN when you do something that challenges your stamina or bodily endurance, like being poisoned.

When your HP is reduced to 0, any excess damage is taken as Wounds. You must then make a Roll to remain conscious, against your Wound TN. An unconscious PC regains consciousness when they recover HP. 

### Stress

Stress reflect's the amount of toll your mind has taken from resisting magical or emotional compulsion. If you ever reach 10 Stress, you suffer a nervous breakdown and can no longer stomach this profession -- retire this character.

Your Stress TN is 10 + Stress. You may have to Roll against your Stress TN when you resist the effects of a spell or face something emotionally distressing.

#### Healing

If you rest for 10 minutes, recover 1d6 HP.

If you rest for 30 minutes and eat a Ration, recover all HP. 

Wounds and Stress can only be healed at a safe haven. Each night you are safe and well-fed, remove 1 Wound and 1 Stress. A hired healer will speed up the process.

### Skill

Your skill is a bonus that applies to Rolls when your Rogue does something they are skilled at. These include, but are not limited to:

* Acrobatic Movements
* Stealth
* Fleeing
* Attacks
* Unarmored Defence
- Combat Maneuvers 

### Inventory

PCs have different types of Inventory Slots.

* 3 On-hand Slots
  These represent items that you are carrying in hand or on an easily accessible part of your body, such as a lasso hanging from your belt, the quiver for your bow, or an arming sword in its sheath by your side. These can be accessed at any time.

* 6 Body Slots
  These represent items worn on your person, such as any armor or headwear. Regular clothes do not count towards these. Each piece of armor worn gives a +1 to your Armor bonus and to your Encumberance.  
  If you do not wear full armor, you may use these slots to store other objects if you can justify wearing them on your person. Getting these items ready for use requires at least one combat turn. Each slot used in this manner contributes 1 to your Encumberance.

* 9 Backpack Slots
  These represent items carried in a backpack. Getting these items out requires at least one combat turn.  
  6 slots fit well in the backpack. But you can overstuff the backpack with an extra three slots -- each of these slots used causes a -1 Move penalty.

An Inventory Slot can contain

* 3 Light objects, such as rations, torches, flasks, daggers.
* 1 Medium object, such as a sword, a quiver of 20 arrows / bolts, a lantern.
* 0.5 Heavy (2-handed) Weapon, e.g. greatsword
* 100 Coins

### Armor and Encumberance

Your Armor bonus is added to Rolls made to avoid damage from opposing Attacks and combat maneuvers when wearing armor. 

Your Encumberance TN = 10 + Encumberance. You may have to Roll against your Encumberance TN when you are making movements in which your gear might weigh you down, such as leaping across a large chasm or sneaking up to a guard.

### Species

Each species in the setting has a unique set of abilities. When you level up, gain the next feature from one of your species.

Each PC starts with at least two species:

- their primary species, ie. the species that the inhabitants of the world immediately recognise you as from your physical appearance, and
- dragon-blood, as one of their ancestors was a dragon.

With your DM's approval, you may also start with a third species, representing your mixed-lineage.

### Your Rogue Talents

Each Rogue has their talents. When you level up, you gain another talent.

### Arcane Dooms

Magic is dangerous, even for the most skilled of wizards. If you channel great arcane power and it goes extremely wrong, mark the first unmarked Doom on the list.

1. Drop to 0 HP, and Roll vs. your Wound TN to prevent passing out.
2. Each subsequent time you cast, Roll vs. your Willpower TN. If you fail, the spell fizzles out.
3. Lose the ability to cast spells permanently.

### Your Hoard

As a dragon-blood, you hoard treasure just as much as gold. When your party come away with a valuable treasure, decide which of you will keep it. (You may need to negotiate and trade gold and treasure around to ensure fairness.) Whoever keeps the treasure writes it down on their sheet in this section, and they gain the its value in XP.

## Level 0 Character Creation

1. Choose your primary species, ie. the species that the inhabitants of the world immediately recognise you as from your looks.
   * Human
   * Dog
   * Halfling
2. Roll a four-sided dice (d4) for your Maximum Hit Points (Max HP).
3. Your stats start at 0.
   * Wounds 0
   * Stress 0
   * Skill 0
   * Armor  0
   * Encumberance 0
4. Roll up or choose your former profession. 
5. Fill in your inventory with
   * 3 days of rations (1 slot)
   * 3 torches (1 slot)
   * A d6 weapon (1 slot)
   * 2 random items (2 slots)
   * 1 Coin
6. Give your PC a name.

## Advancement

Your hoard determines your level, and hence your PC's base power level.

| Level | Hoard (gp) |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 1     | 1000       |
| 2     | 3000       |
| 3     | 7000       |
| 4     | 15000      |

When you level up, you gain the following:

* Increase your HP by d4
* Increase your Skill bonus by 1
* Gain one new Species feature, choosing from the next available features of your species.

After Level 4, every time you increase your hoard by 1000gp, you may swap out one of your species feature for any other available to you.

### Spellcasting

Spells are imprisoned spirits that are summoned forth for a specific purpose with mana, which are represented by d6 Mana Dice (MD). The more mana invested, the more powerful the spell's manifestation. 

Anyone can cast spells if they have (1) a Spell (usually in the form of a scroll or wand), and (2) Mana Dice to spare. Magical Species, like Dragons, gain innate Mana Dice as they level up. Everyone else has to find magical items that give them Mana Dice.

To cast a spell, PCs must hold the spell's container in hand, then select its target and how many MD you want to invest. Then roll the invested MD. Dice showing 1, 2 or 3 are returned to its mana pool, and can be used to cast spells later. Dice that show 4, 5 or 6 are expended until recharged.

The effect of the spell depends on its description. [dice] refers to the number of rolled MD. [sum] refers to the sum of the rolled MD. Spells do not affect any target unless its [sum] is at least equal to the target's level.

If doubles are rolled, the caster suffers a Mishap -- roll on the Mishap table. If triples are rolled, the caster suffers the lowest level Doom on the list that they have yet to suffer. 

**Mishaps**

1. Take 1d6 damage

2. Cannot cast the spell again until the next day

3. Invert spell effect on target

4. Randomize spell targets

5. Magic dice return on 1-2 until end of day

6. Inconvenience related to the spell's effect for \[sum\] days.

When you discover a new spell, you must have the spell identified to understand its full effects. However, you may still cast an unidentified spell with a successful Roll against Stress. If you fail the Roll, you suffer a Mishap instead.

#### Magical Items

Spell spirits are contained in

- Magical wood, like a staff or wand,

- Magical paper, like a scroll or spellbook, or

- A wizard's brain.

Wands and Starves contain a single bonded spell and occupy one inventory slot. They may always be used as long as their wielder has MD to invest. 

A scroll contains a single spell. Three scrolls can be bundled into one inventory slot. Scrolls are vulnerable to damage -- whenever you take fire or acid damage, each scroll has a 50% chance of being destroyed. A spellbook occupies a single inventory slot and holds 10 spells. Spellbooks are protected by waterproof bags and metal covers.

If you cast a Spell from magical paper, the paper is destroyed. However, this destruction invests one free MD into the Spell. This free MD can contribute to Mishaps, and is always spent -- it cannot be absorbed into the caster's Mana pool.

When a wizard dies, their spells are trapped in their brain. Wizarding laboratories can perform rituals to extract these spells. A wizard's brain occupies a single inventory slot, and like a scroll is vulnerable to fire and acid.

Magical clothing, like magical robes and pointy hats, are Mana containers. Magical clothing provide one MD per Body Inventory slot they occupy. These MD are replenish every morning, like innate MD.

### Species

Each Species has 4 features. The features are gained sequentially. 

Each PC has at least two species they may choose from at level up: their primary species and dragon-blood. If in your game, the PC has been biten by a goblin, you may choose to gain goblin features -- Goblinisation is contagious.

If you wish to play as a further mixed-species character, please discuss with your DM at character generation.

Cat? 2nd magical race?

##### Species Template

each template gives +1HP & +1 Initiative?

Starting equipment: item and other animal, linked biologically or otherwise iconic

Starting equipment (addenda): cultural, religious, or problem-approach signifier

A -- Animal nature. Establishes how being this animal works.

A -- Animal feature. Feel free to pull from pop culture as well as biology. If the Animal Nature doesn't provide you anything for combat, this feature should be combat-related.

B -- Animal feature (utility or support)

C -- Animal Feature (combat-related)

D -- Capstone, related to some greater entity

#### Human

Mankind's great strength are war, cooperation and breeding. Every time you Level up as a human, gain 1 Mastery.

Mastery:  

You can spend a Mastery Point to alter an adjacent ally's Roll. You can influence any in-game d20 or damage roll. You cannot influence magic dice, or natural 1s or 20s on a d20. You cannot alter your own roll. You can spend Mastery points after the dice have landed. Mastery points replenish with a full night's rest.

A -- Master of Horses  
You can treat a trained animal you keep as henchman. If it's a war dog or war horse, they can fight as a Level 1 character. Unless something very, very unfortunate happens, your favorite pet will survive even when knocked out of a fight.

B -- Hateful
Humans use one dice step higher when rolling damage.

C -- Communal  
Your Mastery points give a +2 bonus per point spent, instead of +1.

D -- Proud  
You gain a minor noble title. Name your new noble house, select heraldy and house motto. When you fight under your own banner, gain +1 Attack and Armor. Hirelings now have a starting loyalty of +X (16% to flee). 

#### Halfling

Small, friendly, love comforts, lucky. For each Halfling Level, +1 to Save.

A -- Gourmand
You have exceptional taste. With just a tiny taste, you tell what the ingredients are (e.g. if there's poison.) This allows reverse engineering most potions.

A -- Love of Comfort
Whenever you gain a drunkenness point, you heal 1d4 HP. You can do this a number of times equal to your Halfling Level until you sleep it off.

B -- Jolly
When you encounter a creature for the first time, you have a 50% chance to change their Disposition to "Curious" or "Friendly". People just seem to like you.

C -- Lucky Dodge
You critically succeed Armor rolls on 18, 19 or 20.

D -- Damned Little Buggers
Whenever a larger enemy misses you with a melee attack, you may force them to make another melee attack against a target within range. It's possible to make enemies hit themselves with this ability.

#### Really Good Dog

+1 HP and +1 Initiative for every template.

A -- Dog, +1 Attack

You lack hands and cannot climb ropes. Your fur coat gives you +3 Armor as if it were armor, but takes up no inventory Slots. You only have 2 Quick-draw Slots and 4 Body Slots. Your bite deals 1d6 damage. You can recognise scents. You can "talk" freely with people who have known you a long time (other PCs), but are otherwise limited to doggy communication. You are fluent in Canine.

Your intelligence is doggy intelligence. You'll never be able to do calculus, but you can notice the seams of a trap or spot a counterfeit coin.

A -- Best Friends

Pick another PC to be your best friend. Whenever you are both adjacent to each other, you both get +2 on all d20 rolls that you make at the same time against the same thing.

B -- Lick

If you best friend is Dying, you can lick their face to restore them to 1 HP. If your best friend is ever out of control (paralyzed, mind-controleed, raging, etc.) you can nip them to give them a new save against the effect.

B -- Wag

When you wag your tail, humanoid children of all species must save as if vs. charm person.

C -- Sniff

As detect evil and detect magic except range is 3".

C -- Growl, +1 Attack

A single enemy must Save vs Fear or be unable to attack or approach you for one turn. Doesn't work if you are non-threatening. Growling is a standard action.

D -- Takedown

Whenever you bite an opponent and get a 18 or 19 on the Attack Roll, you get a free Maneuver to Trip your target.

D -- Epic Nose

If you spend a minute sniffing a creature, you can learn a terrific amount of things about it. You learn the answers to 1 question about the creature's habits. (e.g. Does it work for the druid? What dungeon level is it from?). If it is possible to follow a trail by scent, you can follow that trail by scent.

Dog Quest

At some point in your career, you will attract the attention of the Dog Barons, who will give you a quest to prove your doggishness. Example quests include killing a Cat Prince (rakshasa) who is hiding in town somewhere, digging into a forgotten barrow and returning with the femur from the wight king who was buried there, or rescuing some prince who fell down a well in orcish territory. (This will probably involve the other PCs chasing after you shouting "Where are you going, boy? Come Back!")

If you refuse or fail this quest, you will be shunned by the Dog Clans of the cities. If you succeed, you will win allies among the Dog Clans and can call on their help in the cities. Examples of help: gossip, relaying messages, safe houses, and / or the assistance of a pack of mangy street dogs.

#### Dragon

Strong, magical and extremely greedy for gold. Choose an element: acid, air, fire, ice, lightning, stone and water. 

A -- Goldnose
You can smell gold, jewels, gem, silver, minerals and crystals of value. If you stand at a crossroads and sniff, the DM will tell you which direction has the most treasure. If you sniff in an empty room, the DM will tell you if you smell the faint odor of potentially buried treasure.

A -- Dragon Breath, +1 MD 

R: 20' cone T: area D:0

Deal \[sum\] damage to anything in the cone. Save for half damage. Wind or Water breath extinguishes all fires smaller than a bonfire. Fire breath sets things on fire. Acid breath bleaches the colour from objects and irritates eyes.

B -- Draconic Hide

Reduce all incoming damage from your draconic element by 2. If not wearing body armor, Armor +3.

B -- Dragonspeech

You understand and can use Dragonspeech.

C -- Retractable Claws and Winglets.

Your claws are weapons that you can instantly extend and retract. Your wings are developed enough to fly for 1d4 rounds, though you cannot hover and must keep moving. Your wings get tired easily so you must take a breather before flying again. Your wings require special clothing and armor to accommodate them.

D -- Dragon Flight

Your wings are fully grown. You have a full flight speed and can hover.

D -- Draconic Roar

R: hearing distance T: \[Sum\] HD of creatures D: 10 min / permanent

Targets fear you. Save negates. If \[sum\] is at least 4 times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent until they see you doing something that dispels the fear.

    2. You don't have to roll to impersonate someone in casual conversation, but gaps in your knowledge can still reveal you. 4-in-6 to let info slip.
    3. You can choose which specific information they reveal, if any, and you can keep them talking for d6 hours.
11. Appraisal
    1. You can tell the rough value (within an order of magnitude) and historical/geographic provenance of items, architecture, etc. 
    2. You can identify an object, effect or creature is magic on sight. Gain the ability to Speak with Art.
    3. Gain the ability to Speak with Magic.
12. Danger Sense
    1. 3-in-6 chance of acting in surprise round when ambushed, advantages on saves against effects you haven't seen yet.
    2. Always act in surprise rounds; always act first in initiative order.
    3. Once, you may cheat death.
13. Historian
    1. On a 1-in-6, you may declare a historical fact relevant to the current situation (negotiate it with the GM). Whether correct or not, it's believed to be true in the current era.
    2. One automatic success per day, then 2-in-6 for each following event.
    3. 3-in-6, and the historical facts you declare can be outlandish - but your reputation will make them believed.
14. The World's Your Stage
    1. Accompanied by a plausible disguise for the situation, people will always assume you are who you appear to be, unless you give them a strong reason not to.
    2. You are a master of disguise. With the aid of a disguise kit, you can spend 1 hour to disguise yourself as belonging to a gender, ethnicity, or similarly sized humanoid species other than your own. Your disguise won't pass close inspection, but it will do the job in any casual encounter unless the people you meet already have reason to be very suspicious of you.
15. Connected
    1. If you’ve spent at least a week in a town, you’ll have built a web of useful contacts. If you want something (items, information, invites to parties, etc) which could possibly be obtained in your location for the right price, then you know someone who can obtain it for you (whether you can afford it or not is another question). You also have contacts who can do favours for you that are no more than mildly illegal. You can call on one favour per day and the GM decides how far they’ll go for you.
    2. Once per session, if it’s not entirely implausible, you meet someone you know who is willing to do modest favours for you. You can decide when and where you want to meet this person, but the GM decides who they are and what they can do for you.
16. Escape Artist
    1. Once per day, if you could plausibly escape from a situation (tied up, awkward conversation), you may do so without needing to roll.
    2. Once per scene, you can escape automatically from a situation you could plausibly escape.
17. Social Magnet
    1. You can convince d6 people in close proximity that you are a close friend over the course of a few minutes, and they will treat you as if you were an old friend until you leave their presence.
    2. 2d6 people in close proximity, and their positive feelings towards you last for d6 days.
18. Act like you belong
    1. You can avoid notice by slipping into a group of 4 or more, provided you are similar in appearance to the group. You are treated as if part of the group, and given access to any resources or restricted areas that they would normally have access to, as long as you accompany them.
    2. You can avoid notice by accompanying even a single individual, or can slip into a group even without the appropriate appearance. After you leave, you are difficult to describe, and your features can't be recollected if you choose.
19. Quick Draw
    1. Gain additional Quick-Draw Slots
20. Dodge
    1. Once per day, you can declare that something doesn't affect you. Works on anything that you could physically dodge.
    2. Twice per day.
21. Tricky
    1. When you roll a Natural 20 on an Attack Roll, you can deal double damage AND attempt a free combat maneuver. When you roll a 19 on an Attack Roll, you deal regular damage and attempt a free combat maneuver.
    2. Your tricky ability expands to 18 and 19. Whenever you attempt a free combat maneuver after rolling 18, 19 or 20, you get advantage on your attempt.
22. Backstab: When you have a situational bonus on an Attack Roll (surprise, elevation, etc.), you deal an additional +1d6 damage.

## Subsystems

### Exploration

#### Random Encounter Roll

The noisiest PC, DM's choice, makes a Luck Roll (usually vs. TN 12). On a failure, something or someone comes your way.

#### Reaction Roll

When you encounter strangers, the most visible party member makes a Luck Roll to determine their reaction to the party.

| Luck Roll | Reaction    |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1-        | Hostile     |
| 2-6       | Aggressive  |
| 7-14      | Uncertain   |
| 15-19     | Indifferent |
| 20+       | Friendly    |

#### Food and Water

After 1 day without water, a character becomes dehydrated, get disadvantage on all Rolls. After 3 days without water, die.

Each day without food causes max HP to reduce by 1.

#### Dungeons

A Dungeon Turn takes about 10 minutes. In that time, PCs may

* Move cautiously through 120 feet, spotting traps along the way,
* Move quickly through 360 feet, discovering traps by triggering them,
* Search a small room
* Force a door open, including by lockpicking
* Take a break, to heal 1d6 HP.

A torch provides bright light in a 30 feet radius, and dim light for another 30 feet. It lasts for an hour, ie. 6 dungeon turns. When acting without light, all Rolls that rely on sight are made with disadvantage.

Every 30 minutes, ie. after 3 dungeon turns, or whenever a loud noice occurs, make a Random Encounter Roll. 

#### Wilderness

PCs can travel at 3 miles per hour if the terrain and weather is good. At half that speed if the terrain is difficult.

Make a Random Encounter roll every 3 hours or whenever the PCs do something that's likely to attract attention.

PCs can safely travel for 8 hours per day. For each further hour of travel, PCs take a Wound and then make a Roll against their Wound TN. On a fail, that PC is no longer able to keep up and must rest.

### Social

Reaction

### Combat

#### Turn Order

If anyone attacks by surprise, they get an extra turn to act before regular turns begin.

To determine the turn order of the Combat round, make a Move roll against the enemies' Move TN. PCs who succeed act before the enemies, PCs who fail act afterwards.

#### Your Turn

On their turn, a PC can move up to (25 + Move*5) feet. And they can do one of the following:

* Make an Attack roll against a target
* Dash, ie. move up to another (25 + Move*5) feet
* Cast a spell
* Retrieve an item from your backpack
* Use an item
* Make a combat maneuver against a target, like trip, shove, grapple, etc.
  Talking or dropping an item can be done freely, and possibly even on someone else's turn. 

Attack rolls are made against the enemy's Armor TN. Ranged attacks are made at disadvantage if the enemy is far away.
On a successful Attack roll, roll your weapon die and reduce the target's HP by that amount. If you roll a 20 on the d20, the attack deals twice as much damage OR you gain a free combat maneuver. If you roll a 1 on the d20, the attack misses and the enemy gets a free counter-attack against you.

| Weapon type                                                   | Weapon die |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Unarmed                                                       | d2         |
| Improvised weapons*                                           | 1d6        |
| Regular weapons                                               | 1d6        |
| 2-handed weapons                                              | 1d8        |
| Note: Improvised weapons make Attack rolls with a -2 penalty. |            |

When you make a combat maneuver, such as tripping, shoving, etc., you make either an Attack or Move Roll versus the opponent's Armor or Move TN. The DM decides which bonus is most applicable. On a success, you perform the maneuver.

#### Defending

When an enemy attacks you, make an Armor roll against their Attack TN. If you succeed, they miss. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you may make a free counter attack or combat maneuver. If you roll a 1 on the d20, the enemy does double damage to you.

#### Fleeing

If you decide to flee combat, on your turn, make a Move Roll versus the Move TN of the enemy you are engaged with. 

#### Morale

When combat turns against the NPCs, such as

1. when their side takes their first death,
2. when half their side has been incapacitated or killed, or
3. if some particularly frightening or spectacular effect occurs,
   the most terrifying PC in that combat, DM's choice, makes a Luck roll versus the enemies Save TN. If the roll succeeds, the NPCs try to run away or surrender

## Running the Game

### DM Principles

* Give your players meaningful decisions and multiple viable options.
* Giving more information rather than less allows for more meaningful decisions.

### Rolls

If success or failure is inevitable, don't call for a Roll. Only call for a Roll if both success and failure lead to interesting outcomes. 

Don't gatekeep information behind a Roll. If there's a chance the Player sees it, tell them.

Failed Rolls have consequences. Sometimes, the most obvious one is a time penalty. Wasted time means more chances for bad things to happen to the PCs.

#### Usual Target Numbers (TN)

If your module does not give a target number for a save or check, use the following:

* Move: 11
* Moving Stealthily: 15
* Saves: 10+HD or 15

#### Monsters

* HD
* Attack
* Armor
* Damage
* Move
* Save (incl. Morale)

### Conversions

#### Saves

5 saves

Fort, Reflex, Will

#### Monsters

* Max Hit Points (HD * d6)
* Attack TN = 10+HD
* Armor TN = identical if ascending AC. If descending, subtract its AC from 19 if it is from OD&D or B/X D&D, or from 20 if from AD&D.
* Move TN = 10 + X, where X is 0 for 25ft. Add 1 for every increase of 5 ft. e.g. Move of 40ft => Move TN = 13.
* Save TN = 10+HD, includes Morale.
