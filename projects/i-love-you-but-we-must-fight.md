## Premise
I Love You But We Must Fight is a solo role-playing game where you play a single Hero tasked with defeating the Great Villain threatening the world. You’ve fought hard, sacrificed much, and now you are preparing for the final showdown. There’s only one hiccup: you love the Villain, and you wish to defeat them without destroying them. This game aims to tell stories like Star Wars and Naruto.

To play, you need a copy of this game's rules, a deck of cards, a six-sided die.
