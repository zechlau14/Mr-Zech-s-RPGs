a current work in progress

## Concept
You are special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and Fern. Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb.

### Tone
This game, which may be played with or without a game master, aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy cartoon. It is everyone's responsibility to maintain a family-friendly time full of cartoon logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off a cliff, jokes and cartoon violence. Dr Goof, the nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never cruel.

Despite this game's light-hearted tone, it is still advisable to have a safety tool or two on hand. The author suggests the [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/) tools.

## Character Creation
1. What kind of house **pet** are you?
  e.g. Platypus, Dog, Hedgehog, Cat, Parrot, Treefrog, Snail etc.
2. Choose your **number**, from 2 to 5.
  A high number means you are better at **PETS** (animal instinct and senses, cuteness and charm). A low number means you are better at **FEDORAS** (spycraft, martial arts and gadgetry). 
3. Give your character a **cute pet name**, like Perry the platypus or Pinky the chihuahua, and a **code name**, like Agent P or Numbah 4.

Your Agent always **has**: a brown fedora, a jet pack, a parachute and a hover car.

## Playing the Game
The game is divided into scenes. While the Agents are out trying to stop their nemesis, back at home their owners Linneaus and Fern are up to their own hijinxs. The game will cut between scenes of the Agents and scenes of their Home. At the start of the game, assign each player an Agent scene and a Home Scene. 

During the **Agent Scenes**, the assigned player answers the scene prompt to establish the scene. Each player then takes turns say how their Agent deals with the issue at hand. When something risky occurs, roll dice (see below).

In the **Home Scenes**, the Agents are not present, and the assigned player answers the scene prompt by narrating the full scene.

### Rolling the Dice
When the Agents do something risky, roll two six-sided dice (2d6) to find out how it goes.

If you're using **PETS** (animal abilities), you want to roll **under or equal to** your number.

If you're using **FEDORAS** (spy abilities), you want to roll **above or equal to** your number.

If **none** of your dice succeed, it goes wrong. Narrate how your action cartoonishly fails and makes things worse.

If **one** dice succeeds, you barely manage it. The other players will agree on a complication or cost, then you must include it as you narrate how your actions barely did what you set up to do.

If **two** dice succeed, you do it well! Narrate how cool your agent is as they do it!

#### Helping
If you want to help someone else who's rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them an extra die.

## Scenes [SKELETON]

### Agent Scene 1: The agents are hanging out with Linneaus and Fern at home. 
_Which part of the home are you in? What are the owners doing?_ 

**Ask everyone**: What in this area of the house suggests that Linneaus and Fern are geniuses?

**Ask everyone**: Your agent receives a notification of an urgent call from mission control. How do you receive it? And how do you ensure Linneaus and Fern do not see you answer it?

### Home Scene 1: "I know what we are going to do today!"
Linneaus and Fern are inspired to do something incredible. What is it? (_Select one or make something up._) What inspired them?
