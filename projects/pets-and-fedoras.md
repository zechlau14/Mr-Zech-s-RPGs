a current work in progress

## Concept
You are special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and Fern. Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb.

### Tone
This game, which may be played with or without a game master, aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy cartoon. It is everyone's responsibility to maintain a family-friendly time full of cartoon logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off a cliff, jokes and cartoon violence. Dr Goof, the nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never cruel.

Despite this game's light-hearted tone, it is still advisable to have a safety tool or two on hand. The author suggests the [Script Change](https://briebeau.com/thoughty/script-change/) tools.

## Character Creation
1. What kind of house **pet** are you?
  e.g. Platypus, Dog, Hedgehog, Cat, Parrot, Treefrog, Snail etc.
2. Choose your **number**, from 2 to 5.
  A high number means you are better at **PETS** (animal instinct and senses, cuteness and charm). A low number means you are better at **FEDORAS** (spycraft, martial arts and gadgetry). 
3. Give your character a **cute pet name**, like Perry the platypus or Pinky the chihuahua, and a **code name**, like Agent P or Numbah 4.
