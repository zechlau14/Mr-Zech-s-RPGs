## Premise
You are special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and Fern. Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb.
