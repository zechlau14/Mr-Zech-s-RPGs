## Psalm 3

*A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.*

O Lord, how my adversaries have increased!  
Many are rising up against me.  
Many are saying of my soul,  
“There is no deliverance for him in God.”  Selah

But You, O Lord, are a shield about me,  
My glory, and the One who lifts my head.  
I was crying to the Lord with my voice,  
And He answered me from His holy mountain.  Selah.  
I lay down and slept;  
I awoke, for the Lord sustains me.  
I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people  
Who have set themselves against me round about.

Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God!  
For You have smitten all my enemies on the cheek;  
You have shattered the teeth of the wicked.  
Salvation belongs to the Lord;  
Your blessing *be* upon Your people! Selah.

## Psalm 95

O come, let us sing for joy to the Lord,  
Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.  
Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving,  
Let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms.  
For the Lord is a great God  
And a great King above all gods,  
In whose hand are the depths of the earth,  
The peaks of the mountains are His also.  
The sea is His, for it was He who made it,  
And His hands formed the dry land.

Come, let us worship and bow down,  
Let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.  
For He is our God,  
And we are the people of His pasture and the sheep of His hand.  
Today, if you would hear His voice,  
Do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah,  
As in the day of Massah in the wilderness,  
“When your fathers tested Me,  
They tried Me, though they had seen My work.  
“For forty years I loathed *that* generation,  
And said they are a people who err in their heart,  
And they do not know My ways.  
“Therefore I swore in My anger,  
Truly they shall not enter into My rest.”

## [Alt] Psalm 100

Shout joyfully to the Lord, all the earth.  
Serve the Lord with gladness;  
Come before Him with joyful singing.  
Know that the Lord Himself is God;  
It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves;  
*We are* His people and the sheep of His pasture.

Enter His gates with thanksgiving  
*And* His courts with praise.  
Give thanks to Him, bless His name.  
For the Lord is good;  
His lovingkindness is everlasting  
And His faithfulness to all generations.

## Psalm 67

*For the choir director; with stringed instruments. A Psalm. A Song.*

God be gracious to us and bless us,  
*And* cause His face to shine upon us— Selah.  
That Your way may be known on the earth,  
Your salvation among all nations.  
Let the peoples praise You, O God;  
Let all the peoples praise You.  
Let the nations be glad and sing for joy;  
For You will judge the peoples with uprightness  
And guide the nations on the earth. Selah.  
Let the peoples praise You, O God;  
Let all the peoples praise You.  
The earth has yielded its produce;  
God, our God, blesses us.  
God blesses us,  
That all the ends of the earth may fear Him.

## Psalm 51

*For the choir director. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.*

Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness;  
According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.  
Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity  
And cleanse me from my sin.  
For I know my transgressions,  
And my sin is ever before me.  
Against You, You only, I have sinned  
And done what is evil in Your sight,  
So that You are justified when You speak  
And blameless when You judge.

Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity,  
And in sin my mother conceived me.  
Behold, You desire truth in the innermost being,  
And in the hidden part You will make me know wisdom.  
Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean;  
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  
Make me to hear joy and gladness,  
Let the bones which You have broken rejoice.  
Hide Your face from my sins  
And blot out all my iniquities.

Create in me a clean heart, O God,  
And renew a steadfast spirit within me.  
Do not cast me away from Your presence  
And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.  
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation  
And sustain me with a willing spirit.  
*Then* I will teach transgressors Your ways,  
And sinners will be converted to You.

Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, the God of my salvation;  
*Then* my tongue will joyfully sing of Your righteousness.  
O Lord, open my lips,  
That my mouth may declare Your praise.  
For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it;  
You are not pleased with burnt offering.  
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;  
A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

By Your favor do good to Zion;  
Build the walls of Jerusalem.  
Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices,  
In burnt offering and whole burnt offering;  
Then young bulls will be offered on Your altar.

## Psalm 148

Praise the Lord!  
Praise the Lord from the heavens;  
Praise Him in the heights!  
Praise Him, all His angels;  
Praise Him, all His hosts!  
Praise Him, sun and moon;  
Praise Him, all stars of light!  
Praise Him, highest heavens,  
And the waters that are above the heavens!  
Let them praise the name of the Lord,  
For He commanded and they were created.  
He has also established them forever and ever;  
He has made a decree which will not pass away.

Praise the Lord from the earth,  
Sea monsters and all deeps;  
Fire and hail, snow and clouds;  
Stormy wind, fulfilling His word;  
Mountains and all hills;  
Fruit trees and all cedars;  
Beasts and all cattle;  
Creeping things and winged fowl;  
Kings of the earth and all peoples;  
Princes and all judges of the earth;  
Both young men and virgins;  
Old men and children.

Let them praise the name of the Lord,  
For His name alone is exalted;  
His glory is above earth and heaven.  
And He has lifted up a horn for His people,  
Praise for all His godly ones;  
*Even* for the sons of Israel, a people near to Him.  
Praise the Lord!

## Psalm 149

Praise the Lord!  
Sing to the Lord a new song,  
*And* His praise in the congregation of the godly ones.  
Let Israel be glad in his Maker;  
Let the sons of Zion rejoice in their King.  
Let them praise His name with dancing;  
Let them sing praises to Him with timbrel and lyre.  
For the Lord takes pleasure in His people;  
He will beautify the afflicted ones with salvation.

Let the godly ones exult in glory;  
Let them sing for joy on their beds.  
*Let* the high praises of God *be* in their mouth,  
And a two-edged sword in their hand,  
To execute vengeance on the nations  
And punishment on the peoples,  
To bind their kings with chains  
And their nobles with fetters of iron,  
To execute on them the judgment written;  
This is an honor for all His godly ones.  
Praise the Lord!

## Psalm 150

Praise the Lord!  
Praise God in His sanctuary;  
Praise Him in His mighty expanse.  
Praise Him for His mighty deeds;  
Praise Him according to His excellent greatness.

Praise Him with trumpet sound;  
Praise Him with harp and lyre.  
Praise Him with timbrel and dancing;  
Praise Him with stringed instruments and pipe.  
Praise Him with loud cymbals;  
Praise Him with resounding cymbals.  
Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.  
Praise the Lord!

## Today's Reading I

## Benedictus (Luke 1:68-79)

"Blessed *be* the Lord God of Israel,  
For He has visited us and accomplished redemption for His people,  
And has raised up a horn of salvation for us  
In the house of David His servant—  
As He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets from of old—  
Salvation from our enemies,  
And from the hand of all who hate us;  
To show mercy toward our fathers,  
And to remember His holy covenant,  
The oath which He swore to Abraham our father,  
To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,  
Might serve Him without fear,  
In holiness and righteousness before Him all our days.  
“And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;  
For you will go on before the Lord to prepare His ways;  
To give to His people *the* knowledge of salvation  
By the forgiveness of their sins,  
Because of the tender mercy of our God,  
With which the Sunrise from on high will visit us,  
To shine upon those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death,  
To guide our feet into the way of peace.

Our Father, who art in heaven,  
Hallowed be thy Name;  
Thy kingdom come;  
Thy will be done  
in earth, as it is in heaven:  
Give us this day our daily bread;  
And forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive them that trespass against us;  
And lead us not into temptation,  
But deliver us from evil;  
Amen.

## Psalm 120

In my trouble I cried to the Lord,  
And He answered me.  
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips,  
From a deceitful tongue.  
What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you,  
You deceitful tongue?  
Sharp arrows of the warrior,  
With the *burning* coals of the broom tree.

Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech,  
For I dwell among the tents of Kedar!  
Too long has my soul had its dwelling  
With those who hate peace.  
I am *for* peace, but when I speak,  
They are for war.

## Psalm 121

I will lift up my eyes to the mountains;  
From where shall my help come?  
My help *comes* from the Lord,  
Who made heaven and earth.  
He will not allow your foot to slip;  
He who keeps you will not slumber.  
Behold, He who keeps Israel  
Will neither slumber nor sleep.

The Lord is your keeper;  
The Lord is your shade on your right hand.  
The sun will not smite you by day,  
Nor the moon by night.  
The Lord will protect you from all evil;  
He will keep your soul.  
The Lord will guard your going out and your coming in  
From this time forth and forever.

## Psalm 122

I was glad when they said to me,  
“Let us go to the house of the Lord.”  
Our feet are standing  
Within your gates, O Jerusalem,  
Jerusalem, that is built  
As a city that is compact together;  
To which the tribes go up, even the tribes of the Lord—  
An ordinance for Israel—  
To give thanks to the name of the Lord.  
For there thrones were set for judgment,  
The thrones of the house of David.

Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:  
“May they prosper who love you.  
“May peace be within your walls,  
And prosperity within your palaces.”  
For the sake of my brothers and my friends,  
I will now say, “May peace be within you.”  
For the sake of the house of the Lord our God,  
I will seek your good.

## Psalm 123

To You I lift up my eyes,  
O You who are enthroned in the heavens!  
Behold, as the eyes of servants *look* to the hand of their master,  
As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress,  
So our eyes *look* to the Lord our God,  
Until He is gracious to us.

Be gracious to us, O Lord, be gracious to us,  
For we are greatly filled with contempt.  
Our soul is greatly filled  
With the scoffing of those who are at ease,  
*And* with the contempt of the proud.

## Psalm 124

“Had it not been the Lord who was on our side,”  
Let Israel now say,  
“Had it not been the Lord who was on our side  
When men rose up against us,  
Then they would have swallowed us alive,  
When their anger was kindled against us;  
Then the waters would have engulfed us,  
The stream would have swept over our soul;  
Then the raging waters would have swept over our soul.”

Blessed be the Lord,  
Who has not given us to be torn by their teeth.  
Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the trapper;  
The snare is broken and we have escaped.  
Our help is in the name of the Lord,  
Who made heaven and earth.

## Psalm 125

Those who trust in the Lord  
Are as Mount Zion, which cannot be moved but abides forever.  
As the mountains surround Jerusalem,  
So the Lord surrounds His people  
From this time forth and forever.  
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest upon the land of the righteous,  
So that the righteous will not put forth their hands to do wrong.

Do good, O Lord, to those who are good  
And to those who are upright in their hearts.  
But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,  
The Lord will lead them away with the doers of iniquity.  
Peace be upon Israel.

## Psalm 126

When the Lord brought back the captive ones of Zion,  
We were like those who dream.  
Then our mouth was filled with laughter  
And our tongue with joyful shouting;  
Then they said among the nations,  
“The Lord has done great things for them.”  
The Lord has done great things for us;  
We are glad.

Restore our captivity, O Lord,  
As the streams in the South.  
Those who sow in tears shall reap with joyful shouting.  
He who goes to and fro weeping, carrying *his* bag of seed,  
Shall indeed come again with a shout of joy, bringing his sheaves *with him*.

## Psalm 127

Unless the Lord builds the house,  
They labor in vain who build it;  
Unless the Lord guards the city,  
The watchman keeps awake in vain.  
It is vain for you to rise up early,  
To retire late,  
To eat the bread of painful labors;  
For He gives to His beloved *even in his* sleep.

Behold, children are a gift of the Lord,  
The fruit of the womb is a reward.  
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior,  
So are the children of one’s youth.  
How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them;  
They will not be ashamed  
When they speak with their enemies in the gate.

## Psalm 128

How blessed is everyone who fears the Lord,  
Who walks in His ways.  
When you shall eat of the fruit of your hands,  
You will be happy and it will be well with you.  
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine  
Within your house,  
Your children like olive plants  
Around your table.  
Behold, for thus shall the man be blessed  
Who fears the Lord.

The Lord bless you from Zion,  
And may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life.  
Indeed, may you see your children’s children.  
Peace be upon Israel!

## Psalm 145

*A psalm of praise, of David*  

The Lord is gracious and merciful;  
Slow to anger and great in lovingkindness.  
The Lord is good to all,  
And His mercies are over all His works.  
All Your works shall give thanks to You, O Lord,  
And Your godly ones shall bless You.  
They shall speak of the glory of Your kingdom  
And talk of Your power;  
To make known to the sons of men Your mighty acts  
And the glory of the majesty of Your kingdom.  
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom,  
And Your dominion *endures* throughout all generations.

The Lord sustains all who fall  
And raises up all who are bowed down.  
The eyes of all look to You,  
And You give them their food in due time.  
You open Your hand  
And satisfy the desire of every living thing.

The Lord is righteous in all His ways  
And kind in all His deeds.  
The Lord is near to all who call upon Him,  
To all who call upon Him in truth.  
He will fulfill the desire of those who fear Him;  
He will also hear their cry and will save them.  
The Lord keeps all who love Him,  
But all the wicked He will destroy.  
My mouth will speak the praise of the Lord,  
And all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever.

And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.

For behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed.

“He has brought down rulers from *their* thrones,  
And has exalted those who were humble.  
“He has filled the hungry with good things;  
And sent away the rich empty-handed.  
“He has given help to Israel His servant,  
In remembrance of His mercy,  
As He spoke to our fathers,  
To Abraham and his descendants forever.”

## Psalm 4

*For the choir director; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David.*

Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness!  
You have relieved me in my distress;  
Be gracious to me and hear my prayer.

O sons of men, how long will my honor become a reproach?  
*How long* will you love what is worthless and aim at deception? Selah.  
But know that the Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself;  
The Lord hears when I call to Him.

Tremble, and do not sin;  
Meditate in your heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.  
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,  
And trust in the Lord.

Many are saying, “Who will show us *any* good?”  
Lift up the light of Your countenance upon us, O Lord!  
You have put gladness in my heart,  
More than when their grain and new wine abound.  
In peace I will both lie down and sleep,  
For You alone, O Lord, make me to dwell in safety.

## Psalm 91

He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High  
Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.  
I will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress,  
My God, in whom I trust!”  
For it is He who delivers you from the snare of the trapper  
And from the deadly pestilence.  
He will cover you with His pinions,  
And under His wings you may seek refuge;  
His faithfulness is a shield and bulwark.

You will not be afraid of the terror by night,  
Or of the arrow that flies by day;  
Of the pestilence that stalks in darkness,  
Or of the destruction that lays waste at noon.  
A thousand may fall at your side  
And ten thousand at your right hand,  
*But* it shall not approach you.  
You will only look on with your eyes  
And see the recompense of the wicked.  
For you have made the Lord, my refuge,  
*Even* the Most High, your dwelling place.  
No evil will befall you,  
Nor will any plague come near your tent.

For He will give His angels charge concerning you,  
To guard you in all your ways.  
They will bear you up in their hands,  
That you do not strike your foot against a stone.  
You will tread upon the lion and cobra,  
The young lion and the serpent you will trample down.

“Because he has loved Me, therefore I will deliver him;  
I will set him *securely* on high, because he has known My name.  
“He will call upon Me, and I will answer him;  
I will be with him in trouble;  
I will rescue him and honor him.  
“With a long life I will satisfy him  
And let him see My salvation.”

## Psalm 134

*A song of Ascents*

Behold, bless the Lord, all servants of the Lord,  
Who serve by night in the house of the Lord!  
Lift up your hands to the sanctuary  
And bless the Lord.  
May the Lord bless you from Zion,  
He who made heaven and earth.

## Nunc dimittis (Luke 2:29-32)

“Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in peace,  
According to Your word;  
For my eyes have seen Your salvation,  
Which You have prepared in the presence of all peoples,  
A Light of revelation to the Gentiles,  
And the glory of Your people Israel.”
