# Pets with Fedoras

A story game for 2 -- 5 players.
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb. 

---
# 0

Take turns drawing the cards and reading them out loud.

---
# Introduction 1

You are special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and 
Fern. 

---
# Introduction 2

Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  

---
# Introduction 3

While you are away on mission, your genius owners are up to their own mad science mega-project in the backyard. 

---
# Introduction 4

Our story cuts back and forth between your mission and the children's project.

---
# Introduction 5

Give out one Mission Card and one Home Card to every player. 

---
# Introduction 6

If you have less than 5 players, distribute the remaining cards equally.

---

# Introduction 7 

When we have read the Instructions cards, we will alternate between Mission cards and Home cards, beginning with the 1st Mission Card.

---

# Introduction 8

On your turn, read your card out loud and answer the question for you. 

---

# Introduction 9

This game aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy cartoon. Your answer should be family-friendly and fueled by cartoon logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off a cliff.

# Introduction 10

Cartoon violence is encouraged, but not blood and gore. Dr Goof, your nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never cruel.

# Introduction 11

Other players may ask you questions or make suggestions on your turn, but whether you answer those questions or include those suggestions is entirely up to you.

---
# Introduction 12

Then everyone rolls their six-sided die to in what order we answer the question for everyone, beginning with the lowest roll.

---
# Introduction 13

If your turn to answer is in the first half, your answer must include how your agent's action cartoonishly fails. If your turn is in the second half, your answer should include how your agent succeeds and helps one of their fellow agents who was struggling earlier.

---
# Introduction 14

Place the X-Card in the middle where everyone can easily reach it.

---
# Introduction 15

If there is an answer in the game that you don't want to be included, tap the X-card or say "X!" The answering player will provide a different answer.

## Character Creation
1. What kind of house **pet** are you?
  e.g. Platypus, Dog, Hedgehog, Cat, Parrot, Treefrog, Snail etc.
2. Choose your **number**, from 2 to 5.
  A high number means you are better at **PETS** (animal instinct and senses, cuteness and charm). A low number means you are better at **FEDORAS** (spycraft, martial arts and gadgetry). 
3. Give your character a **cute pet name**, like Perry the platypus or Pinky the chihuahua, and a **code name**, like Agent P or Numbah 4.

Your Agent always **has**: a brown fedora, a jet pack, a parachute and a hover car.

## Playing the Game
The game is divided into scenes. While the Agents are out trying to stop their nemesis, back at home their owners Linneaus and Fern are up to their own hijinxs. The game will cut between scenes of the Agents and scenes of their Home. At the start of the game, assign each player an Agent scene and a Home Scene. 

During the **Agent Scenes**, the assigned player answers the scene prompt to establish the scene. Each player then takes turns say how their Agent deals with the issue at hand. When something risky occurs, roll dice (see below).

In the **Home Scenes**, the Agents are not present, and the assigned player answers the scene prompt by narrating the full scene.

### Rolling the Dice
When the Agents do something risky, roll two six-sided dice (2d6) to find out how it goes.

If you're using **PETS** (animal abilities), you want to roll **under or equal to** your number.

If you're using **FEDORAS** (spy abilities), you want to roll **above or equal to** your number.

If **none** of your dice succeed, it goes wrong. Narrate how your action cartoonishly fails and makes things worse.

If **one** dice succeeds, you barely manage it. The other players will agree on a complication or cost, then you must include it as you narrate how your actions barely did what you set up to do.

If **two** dice succeed, you do it well! Narrate how cool your agent is as they do it!

#### Helping
If you want to help someone else who's rolling, say how you try to help and make a roll. If you succeed, give them an extra die.

## Scenes [SKELETON]

### Agent Scene 1 
The agents are hanging out with Linneaus and Fern at home. _Which part of the home are you in? What are the owners doing?_ 

**Ask everyone**: What in this area of the house suggests that Linneaus and Fern are geniuses?

**Ask everyone**: Your agent receives a notification of an urgent call from mission control. How do you receive it? And how do you ensure Linneaus and Fern do not see you answer it?

**Ask everyone**: After the call ends, how does your agent sneak out of the house? And what form of transportation are you using?

### Agent Scene 4
_What is Dr. Goofenheim's evil plot? Choose or create a motive, and craft a short silly memory related to their motive. Then choose or make up a cartoon science invention to help them achieve it in a petty / hilariously inefficient manner._

| d6 | Invention | Motive |

| 6 | Paper Cut-inator | To remove a pet peeve |

Narrate Dr. Goofenheim arriving at the trap holding the agents and monologuing about his evil plan. (If there are more than traps sprung in the last Agent Scene, _choose_ which agent they appear before and projects images of himself to the other agents.) 

**Ask everyone**: As Dr. Goofenheim's monologue ends, what does your agent do to attempt to break out of the trap?

### Home Scene 4
Linnaeus and Fern have completed the preparations of their project. Narrate how they and their friends launch their invention / begin their performance / game.

### Agent Scene 5
It's the final showdown as Dr. Goofenheim tries to turn his invention on. _Does he manage to turn it on? If he does, does it work as plan or cartoonishly backfire?_ No matter what you choose, narrate how it raises the stakes.

**Ask everyone**: What does your agent do? And how does your actions bring Dr. Goof and your agent into contact with Linnaeus and Fern's invention, without the children noticing them?

### Home Scene 5
Linnaeus and Fern and friends complete their project as Cam is ushering their parent(s) around the corner. What happens to erase evidence of the project before they are discovered? What do the parents return to find the children and their pets doing?
