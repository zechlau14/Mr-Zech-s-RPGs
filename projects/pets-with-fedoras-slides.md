___
# Introduction 0

Take turns drawing the cards and reading them out loud.

___
# Introduction 1

You are fedora-wearing special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and Fern. 

Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  

___
# Introduction 2

While you are away on mission, your genius owners are up to their own mad science mega-project in the backyard. 

The story cuts back and forth between your mission and the children's project.

___
# Introduction 3

Give out one Mission Card and one Home Card to every player. 

If you have less than 5 players, distribute the remaining cards equally.

___
# Introduction 4

When we have read the Instructions cards, we will alternate between Mission cards and Home cards, beginning with the 1st Mission Card. 

In other words, the play order is Mission 1 -> Home 1 -> Mission 2 -> Home 2 -> etc.

___
# Introduction 5

On your turn, read your Mission or Home card out loud and answer the question(s) directed to you. You may choose and embellish an answer from the suggestion list on the card or come up with something new.

Other players may ask you questions or make suggestions on your turn, but whether you answer those questions or include those suggestions is entirely up to you.

___
# Introduction 6

This game aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy cartoon. Your answers should be family-friendly and fueled by cartoon logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off a cliff.

Cartoon violence is encouraged, but not blood and gore. Dr Goof, your nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never cruel.

___
# Introduction 7

On each Mission card, there is a question for everyone. Pair up and play rock paper scissors (RPS) to determine the order that you answer, beginning with the RPS losers. (Variant: If playing online, you may choose to flip a coin instead.)

If there are an odd number of players, the card reader does not play RPS and may choose to join either the winner or loser side.

___
# Introduction 8

If you lost at RPS, your answer must include how your agent's action cartoonishly fails. 

If you won at RPS, your answer should include how your agent succeeds and helps the agent of the player who lost in RPS against you.

___
# Introduction 9

Place the X-Card in the middle where everyone can easily reach it.

If there is an answer in the game that you don't want to be included, tap the X-card or say "X!" The answering player will provide a different answer.

___
