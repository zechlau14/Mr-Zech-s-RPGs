## Pets with Fedoras

A story game for 2 -- 5 players.  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb. 

---
# Introduction 0

Take turns drawing the cards and reading them out loud.

---
# Introduction 1

You are fedora-wearing special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and 
Fern. 

---
# Introduction 2

Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  

---
# Introduction 3

While you are away on mission, your genius owners are up to their own mad science mega-project in the backyard. 

---
# Introduction 4

Our story cuts back and forth between your mission and the children's project.

---
# Introduction 5

Give out one Mission Card and one Home Card to every player. 

---
# Introduction 6

If you have less than 5 players, distribute the remaining cards equally.

---

# Introduction 7 

When we have read the Instructions cards, we will alternate between Mission cards and Home cards, beginning with the 1st Mission Card.

---

# Introduction 8

On your turn, read your card out loud and answer the question for you. You may choose and embellish an answer from the list on the card or come up with something new.

---

# Introduction 9

This game aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy cartoon. Your answer should be family-friendly and fueled by cartoon logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off a cliff.

---
# Introduction 10

Cartoon violence is encouraged, but not blood and gore. Dr Goof, your nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never cruel.

---
# Introduction 11

Other players may ask you questions or make suggestions on your turn, but whether you answer those questions or include those suggestions is entirely up to you.

---
# Introduction 12

Then everyone rolls their six-sided die to in what order we answer the question for everyone, beginning with the lowest roll.

---
# Introduction 13

If your turn to answer is in the first half, your answer must include how your agent's action cartoonishly fails. If your turn is in the second half, your answer should include how your agent succeeds and helps one of their fellow agents who was struggling earlier.

---
# Introduction 14

Place the X-Card in the middle where everyone can easily reach it.

---
# Introduction 15

If there is an answer in the game that you don't want to be included, tap the X-card or say "X!" The answering player will provide a different answer.

---
# Introduction 16

**For everyone**: What kind of house **pet** are you?  
e.g. Platypus, Dog, Hedgehog, Cat, Parrot, Treefrog, Snail etc.

Then give your character a **cute pet name**, like Perry the platypus or Pinky the chihuahua, and a **code name**, like Agent P or Numbah 4.

---
# Mission 1 
The agents are hanging out with Linneaus and Fern at home. 

**For you**: Which part of the home are you in? What are Linneaus and Fern doing?

**For everyone**: Your agent receives a notification of an urgent call from mission control. How do you receive it? And how do you ensure Linneaus and Fern do not see you answer it?

---
# Home 1
**For you**: What are Linneaus and Fern going to do today? What inspired them?

---
# Mission 2
**For you**: What suspicious activity has Dr. Goofenheim been spotted doing? How does the agents' handler gives them this information and order them to investigate?

| d6 | Suspicious Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Bought all the {random object} in the state | 
| 2 | Purchased a blimp |
| 3 | Stole a couple of wax figures from a museum |
| 4 | Just blasted off in a rocket |
| 5 | Bought an ad with {program/influencer} |
| 6 | Absolutely nothing, which is the most suspicious of all |

**For everyone**: After the call ends, how does your agent sneak out of the house? What form of transportation will you use?

---
# Home 2

**For you**: As the agents leave their home, the camera pans over to see Linneaus and Fern starting their project. How are they getting the necessary materials / ingredients? Which of their friends has come over to help them?

---
# Mission 3
**For you**: The agents arrive at Dr. Goof's lair. Where is it? What trap has Dr. Goof prepared for the agents?

| d6 | Trap |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Duct tape | 
| 2 | A loop of rope |
| 3 | Bubblegum |
| 4 | Quick-drying cement |
| 5 | Air tunnel |
| 6 | Dog carrier |

**Ask everyone**: How do you approach the lair? How does it lead to the trap?

---
# Home 3
**For you**: Back at home, Linneaus and Fern's older sibling, Cam, has walked in on their shenanigans. They rush off to tattle. What is their parent doing? What does Cam say and why do they blow off Cam?

---
# Mission 4
_What is Dr. Goofenheim's evil plot? Choose or create a motive, and craft a short silly memory related to their motive. Then choose or make up a cartoon science invention to help them achieve it in a petty / hilariously inefficient manner._

| d6 | Invention | Motive |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Magnetism intensifier | To get back at their sibling |
| 2 | Copy and Paste-inator | To impress their child |
| 3 | Poop-inator | To launch their new business |
| 4 | Media-eraser | To erase evidence of an embarassment | 
| 5 | Invisible ray | To make up for a childhood trauma | 
| 6 | Paper Cut-inator | To remove a pet peeve |

Narrate Dr. Goofenheim arriving at the trap holding the agents and monologuing about his evil plan. (If there are more than traps sprung in the last Agent Scene, _choose_ which agent they appear before and projects images of himself to the other agents.) 

**Ask everyone**: As Dr. Goofenheim's monologue ends, what does your agent do to attempt to break out of the trap?

### Home Scene 4
Linnaeus and Fern have completed the preparations of their project. Narrate how they and their friends launch their invention / begin their performance / game.

### Agent Scene 5
It's the final showdown as Dr. Goofenheim tries to turn his invention on. _Does he manage to turn it on? If he does, does it work as plan or cartoonishly backfire?_ No matter what you choose, narrate how it raises the stakes.

**Ask everyone**: What does your agent do? And how does your actions bring Dr. Goof and your agent into contact with Linnaeus and Fern's invention, without the children noticing them?

### Home Scene 5
Linnaeus and Fern and friends complete their project as Cam is ushering their parent(s) around the corner. What happens to erase evidence of the project before they are discovered? What do the parents return to find the children and their pets doing?
