## Pets and Fedoras

A story game for 2 -- 5 players.  
This work is directly inspired by the cartoon Phineas and Ferb. 

---
# Introduction 0

Take turns drawing the cards and reading them out loud.

---
# Introduction 1

You are fedora-wearing special agents of the NNSA (Never Named Spy Agency) with cover identities as ordinary house pets belonging to a pair of genius children, Linneaus and 
Fern. 

---
# Introduction 2

Your mission, as always, is to find out what your evil scientist nemesis, Dr. Goofenheim, is up to and put a stop to it!  

---
# Introduction 3

While you are away on mission, your genius owners are up to their own mad science mega-project in the backyard. 

---
# Introduction 4

Our story cuts back and forth between your mission and the children's project.

---
# Introduction 5

Give out one Mission Card and one Home Card to every player. 

---
# Introduction 6

If you have less than 5 players, distribute the remaining cards equally.

---

# Introduction 7 

When we have read the Instructions cards, we will alternate between Mission cards and Home cards, beginning with the 1st Mission Card.

---

# Introduction 8

On your turn, read your card out loud and answer the question(s). You may choose and embellish an answer from the list on the card or come up with something new.

---

# Introduction 9

This game aims to emulate an episode of a Saturday morning spy cartoon. Your answer should be family-friendly and fueled by cartoon logic, like continuing to run on air for a few seconds after running off a cliff.

---
# Introduction 10

Cartoon violence is encouraged, but not blood and gore. Dr Goof, your nemesis may be petty and/or greedy, but they and their schemes are never cruel.

---
# Introduction 11

Other players may ask you questions or make suggestions on your turn, but whether you answer those questions or include those suggestions is entirely up to you.

---
# Introduction 12

If there is a question for everyone, then we each roll our six-sided die to discover the order that we answer, beginning with the lowest roll.

---
# Introduction 13

If your turn to answer is in the first half, your answer must include how your agent's action cartoonishly fails. If your turn is in the second half, your answer should include how your agent succeeds and helps one of their fellow agents who was struggling earlier.

---
# Introduction 14

Place the X-Card in the middle where everyone can easily reach it.

---
# Introduction 15

If there is an answer in the game that you don't want to be included, tap the X-card or say "X!" The answering player will provide a different answer.

---
# Introduction 16

**For everyone**: What kind of house **pet** are you?  
e.g. Platypus, Dog, Hedgehog, Cat, Parrot, Treefrog, Snail etc.

Then give your character a **cute pet name**, like Perry the platypus or Pinky the chihuahua, and a **code name**, like Agent P or Numbah 4.

---
# Mission 1 
The agents are hanging out with Linneaus and Fern at home. Which part of the home are you in? What are Linneaus and Fern doing?
