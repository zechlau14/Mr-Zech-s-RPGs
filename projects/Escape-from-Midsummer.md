## Premise
One midsummer night, when the veil between the faewilds and our world is thinnest, you accidentally wandered over to the other side. It was fun exploring at first, but you've noticed something wrong. The realm is making a claim on you -- transforming you into a part of itself. Will you be able to escape before sunrise when the fae claim you forever?

## Character Creation

1. What is your character's occupation?
2. Why does the faewild love you? What about you is attractive to the fae?
3. What drives you to return home?

## Rolling the Dice


## Credits
Based on Graham W's Cthulhu Dark.
