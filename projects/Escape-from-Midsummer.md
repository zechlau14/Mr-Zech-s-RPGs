## Premise
One midsummer night, when the veil between the faewilds and our world is thinnest, you accidentally wandered over to the other side. It was fun exploring at first, but you've noticed something wrong. The realm is making a claim on you -- transforming you into a part of itself. Will you be able to escape before sunrise when the fae claim you forever?

## Character Creation

1. What is your character's occupation?
2. Why does the faewild love you? What about you is attractive to the fae?
3. What drives you to return home?

## Rolling the Dice
To play the game, you need two six-sided dice and a different colored six-sided die, which we will refer to as the dark die. 

### Attunement
Attunement is the measure of how much the faewild has dug its claws into you. It starts at 1. If it reaches 6, you are lost to the faewild and can never return home.

When the faewild makes a claim on you or you encounter something alien that disturbs your human mind, make an **Attunement Roll** by rolling the dark die. If the result of the dark die is greater than your Attunement, the Faewild's power takes hold of you, mutating you. Either make up a mutation that is fictionally appropriate or roll on the mutation table, and record it. Then Increase your Attunement by one.

### Doing Stuff
When you do stuff, gather dice.
* one die if you are doing something within human capabilities
* add one die if your occupation or one of your mutations would give you an advantage on the task
* add the dark die if you take the risk to draw on the Fae realm's power to aid you in the task.

Roll the dice. The die with the highest result tells us how well you performed the task.
1-3  You barely did it.
4-5  You did it well.
6    You did it supernaturally well.
If the highest die is a dark die, it counts as an Attunement Roll, so the character's Attunement increases if the result is greater than the character's current Attunement.

If someone at the table feels that it would be interesting if the action fails, they can roll a die against them. If this opposition die is greater than the acting character's highest die, then the action fails.

If a player is unsatisfied with their result and their highest die was not a dark die, then they may add a dark die to their dice pool and reroll it.

### Reduction Roll
When a character's Attunement reaches five, they unlock the Reduction Roll. When the character takes action to reassert their humanity, roll the dark die. If the dark die is lower than their Attunement, decrease it by one and erase a fictionally appropriate mutation.
